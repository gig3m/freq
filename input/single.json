{"data":[{"body":["In writing, hyphens are often used to combine ( compound ) or divide words. Interestingly enough, they work pretty much the same way in people. Though we use them in an effort to combine two names or descriptions into one, they often wind up being more divisive than anything else. For instance…   In marriage, names are sometimes hyphenated. Presumably, this is done to allow the retaining and incorporation of the wife’s family name. Sometimes, the husband even adopts this new hyphenated last name also as a show of support and solidarity. Thus, rather than being the Jones family, the new couple becomes the Smith-Jones family. In time, Mr. and Mrs. Smith-Jones produce offspring, also duly saddled with the double moniker, Smith-Jones. But here’s where this plan goes off the rails. What if little Johnny Smith-Jones grows up and decides to marry Susie Jones-Smith (whose parents had the same idea)? Is their forth-coming little bundle of joy to be Billy Smith-Jones-Jones-Smith? Let alone the possibility that little Billy grows up to marry a quadruple-hyphenated girl!  Besides the potential mess illustrated above, is there actually anything biblically wrong with hyphenated marriages? Perhaps not, but the Bible does say that a man “shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh,”  Genesis 2:23 ; Matthew 19:4-5 . While these passages admittedly say nothing of name sharing directly, they do command that the couple become “one flesh.” Surely such includes the sexual union, but it is much more. “One flesh” means that they become one couple, rather than two separate individuals trying to retain their former individuality while trying to be one,  cf. Ephesians 5:28-32 . If they are going to share a life, and be one couple, shouldn’t they also share one name?   Nationalities are increasingly hyphenated. As in marriage, this has become more popular in recent years. Many are not content with being an “American,” but feel the need to put some other country before it with a hyphen between, as in “Xxxxxxx-American.” This is often done despite the fact that neither they, nor any ancestor they can identify, ever resided in the other country. While it may be just an effort of taking pride in heritages by combining them, this insistence on a hyphenated nationality can also divide the country by emphasizing our differences rather than uniting under a common flag. It actually highlights, as did marriage, the problem of split allegiances.   Yes, America is a “land of immigrants,” and “the melting pot of the world.” But, one of the things that previously made this country great was that immigrants wanted to be, first and foremost, “Americans.” They were willing to leave their country of origin, endure tremendous hardships to get here, then learn a new language and new customs, and start over by adopting a new nationality. They wanted to be “Americans,” not a hyphenated hybrid of such. Biblically and otherwise, names are important because they both describe relationships and reflect allegiances, cf.1Peter 2:9-10 . But perhaps most importantly,   Religious Affiliations are all-too-often hyphenated. Few are content, it seems, with being just a “Christian,” opting instead for “ insert denominational name of choice -Christian.” The problem is, no denominational names were used to describe and delineate disciples in the New Testament. They were just “Christians”- so no hyphens were needed, “…and the disciples were first called Christians…”  Acts 11:26 . In fact, Paul condemned the idea of Christians trying to maintain any sort of dual allegiance (with Christ and any man) in 1Corinthians 1:12-13 , “…each one of you is saying, ‘I am of Paul,’ and ‘I of Apollos,’ and ‘I of Cephas,’ and ‘I of Christ.’ Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?” Although no hyphens were literally used then, the practice denounced is the same as what some are doing now- dividing the body of Christ and failing to be of “the same mind” and “the same judgment,”  1Corinthians 1:10 ! Why would anyone do such a thing? Misplaced loyalties and split allegiances are again the problem, just as was the case with marriage and nationality. We cannot be hyphenated Christians. Anything hyphenated with Christ(ian) is too much, and fails to maintain the sole loyalty and allegiance demanded, Matthew 4:10 ; Acts 5:29 !   Words must sometimes be combined or divided by a hyphen for good reasons, but hyphens do far more to divide, rather than combine, people  ."],"title":["Hyphenated People"],"_resultNumber":1,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/hyphenated_people","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":1},{"body":["The title is not suggestive of some sort of “religious” circular dough that has been deep-fried and sprinkled or glazed with sugar, though there are probably points to be made along those lines also.

These “do-nuts” have definite comparisons to some “spiritual” pursuits today…   The Purpose of Do-Nuts. Any teenager, or adult acting like one, does a “do-nut” for one or more of a couple of reasons: 1) To show off or gain attention seems to be a primary purpose; 2) to exhibit power, which is closely tied to the previous; and/or, 3) to leave circular black marks on the pavement, or deep groves in the dirt, in tribute to purposes 1 and 2.  The spiritually immature do “religious do-nuts” for the same reasons. Some activities are perhaps “performed” under the guise of benefiting others, but are really just efforts to gain attention for oneself. A couple of NT examples should help to clarify. In Matthew 6:1 , Jesus warned His disciples against doing spiritual do-nuts when He said, “Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.” He then went on to provide three specific examples: giving alms to be seen by others, vv.2-4 ; praying to be seen (or heard) by others, vv.5-15 ; and fasting to be seen by others, vv.16-18 .  However, the activities done “to be noticed” by others are not limited to giving, praying, or how we present ourselves. In the church at Corinth, certain spiritual gifts were more highly sought than others because they were apparently deemed to bring greater prestige to the possessor, see 1Corinthians 14:1-4ff . So, Paul had to remind them that the purpose of all spiritual gifts was to edify the body (in this case, the local church), vv.12,26 , rather than self,  v.4 .  Now, whether we’re giving of our means (by contribution in the assembly, or by charity out of the assembly), praying, showcasing ourselves as godly people, or even leading the assembly in some facet of worship or bible study, if our purpose is to bring attention to ourselves, we’re immature and just doing “spiritual do-nuts”!   The Results of Do-Nuts. We’re not heading into gluttony or obesity here because the subject is still the do-nuts you “do” instead of those you “eat.” But if you think about it, there are some interesting similarities between do-nuts done in a parking lot or on a dirt road, and those done in spiritual terms. In either setting, doing do-nuts:  1) Makes a lot of noise and throws a lot of dust in the air, but accomplishes nothing in practical terms. Thus, they’re all about the “show,” or at least “showing off.” They are the polar opposites of poor in spirit and pure in heart,  Matthew 5:3,8 .  2) Get you nowhere. You’re literally “spinning in circles,” and the only places such will get you is dizzy or in trouble, or both. This was Jesus’ primary point in Matthew 6:1-18 . Whatever notoriety or acclaim is gained from those willing to watch and applaud is all the do-nut doer will get because God is neither served by nor approves of such. As Jesus said, “they have their reward in full,”  vv.2,5,16 .   3) Is destructive. Physically, doing do-nuts ruins the tires, and is tremendously hard on drivetrains. Doing spiritual do-nuts (as described above) fractures fellowships, destroys credibility, and turns what is supposed to be “worship” into “performance art” or a “talent show.” “Worship” is supposed to be the “engine/drivetrain” that moves us closer to God and heaven. Don’t waste it doing do-nuts.  “Doing do-nuts” can be a lot of fun physically or spiritually , if you’re immature and selfish enough to relish excessive noise, dirt in the air, destruction, and showing off instead of moving forward to the destination."],"title":["Spiritual “Do-Nuts”"],"_resultNumber":2,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/spiritual_do_nuts","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":2}],"Object[0]":{"body":["In writing, hyphens are often used to combine ( compound ) or divide words.
