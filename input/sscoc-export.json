{"data":[{"body":["In writing, hyphens are often used to combine ( compound ) or divide words. Interestingly enough, they work pretty much the same way in people. Though we use them in an effort to combine two names or descriptions into one, they often wind up being more divisive than anything else. For instance…   In marriage, names are sometimes hyphenated. Presumably, this is done to allow the retaining and incorporation of the wife’s family name. Sometimes, the husband even adopts this new hyphenated last name also as a show of support and solidarity. Thus, rather than being the Jones family, the new couple becomes the Smith-Jones family. In time, Mr. and Mrs. Smith-Jones produce offspring, also duly saddled with the double moniker, Smith-Jones. But here’s where this plan goes off the rails. What if little Johnny Smith-Jones grows up and decides to marry Susie Jones-Smith (whose parents had the same idea)? Is their forth-coming little bundle of joy to be Billy Smith-Jones-Jones-Smith? Let alone the possibility that little Billy grows up to marry a quadruple-hyphenated girl!  Besides the potential mess illustrated above, is there actually anything biblically wrong with hyphenated marriages? Perhaps not, but the Bible does say that a man “shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh,”  Genesis 2:23 ; Matthew 19:4-5 . While these passages admittedly say nothing of name sharing directly, they do command that the couple become “one flesh.” Surely such includes the sexual union, but it is much more. “One flesh” means that they become one couple, rather than two separate individuals trying to retain their former individuality while trying to be one,  cf. Ephesians 5:28-32 . If they are going to share a life, and be one couple, shouldn’t they also share one name?   Nationalities are increasingly hyphenated. As in marriage, this has become more popular in recent years. Many are not content with being an “American,” but feel the need to put some other country before it with a hyphen between, as in “Xxxxxxx-American.” This is often done despite the fact that neither they, nor any ancestor they can identify, ever resided in the other country. While it may be just an effort of taking pride in heritages by combining them, this insistence on a hyphenated nationality can also divide the country by emphasizing our differences rather than uniting under a common flag. It actually highlights, as did marriage, the problem of split allegiances.   Yes, America is a “land of immigrants,” and “the melting pot of the world.” But, one of the things that previously made this country great was that immigrants wanted to be, first and foremost, “Americans.” They were willing to leave their country of origin, endure tremendous hardships to get here, then learn a new language and new customs, and start over by adopting a new nationality. They wanted to be “Americans,” not a hyphenated hybrid of such. Biblically and otherwise, names are important because they both describe relationships and reflect allegiances, cf.1Peter 2:9-10 . But perhaps most importantly,   Religious Affiliations are all-too-often hyphenated. Few are content, it seems, with being just a “Christian,” opting instead for “ insert denominational name of choice -Christian.” The problem is, no denominational names were used to describe and delineate disciples in the New Testament. They were just “Christians”- so no hyphens were needed, “…and the disciples were first called Christians…”  Acts 11:26 . In fact, Paul condemned the idea of Christians trying to maintain any sort of dual allegiance (with Christ and any man) in 1Corinthians 1:12-13 , “…each one of you is saying, ‘I am of Paul,’ and ‘I of Apollos,’ and ‘I of Cephas,’ and ‘I of Christ.’ Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?” Although no hyphens were literally used then, the practice denounced is the same as what some are doing now- dividing the body of Christ and failing to be of “the same mind” and “the same judgment,”  1Corinthians 1:10 ! Why would anyone do such a thing? Misplaced loyalties and split allegiances are again the problem, just as was the case with marriage and nationality. We cannot be hyphenated Christians. Anything hyphenated with Christ(ian) is too much, and fails to maintain the sole loyalty and allegiance demanded, Matthew 4:10 ; Acts 5:29 !   Words must sometimes be combined or divided by a hyphen for good reasons, but hyphens do far more to divide, rather than combine, people  ."],"title":["Hyphenated People"],"_resultNumber":1,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/hyphenated_people","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":1},{"body":["The title is not suggestive of some sort of “religious” circular dough that has been deep-fried and sprinkled or glazed with sugar, though there are probably points to be made along those lines also. Instead, the “do-nut” under consideration is the type done with a motorized vehicle- the kind where the front wheels barely move in a tight circle and the back wheels are spinning and squealing in a larger smoking or dirt-slinging circle around the outside. These “do-nuts” have definite comparisons to some “spiritual” pursuits today…   The Purpose of Do-Nuts. Any teenager, or adult acting like one, does a “do-nut” for one or more of a couple of reasons: 1) To show off or gain attention seems to be a primary purpose; 2) to exhibit power, which is closely tied to the previous; and/or, 3) to leave circular black marks on the pavement, or deep groves in the dirt, in tribute to purposes 1 and 2.  The spiritually immature do “religious do-nuts” for the same reasons. Some activities are perhaps “performed” under the guise of benefiting others, but are really just efforts to gain attention for oneself. A couple of NT examples should help to clarify. In Matthew 6:1 , Jesus warned His disciples against doing spiritual do-nuts when He said, “Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.” He then went on to provide three specific examples: giving alms to be seen by others, vv.2-4 ; praying to be seen (or heard) by others, vv.5-15 ; and fasting to be seen by others, vv.16-18 .  However, the activities done “to be noticed” by others are not limited to giving, praying, or how we present ourselves. In the church at Corinth, certain spiritual gifts were more highly sought than others because they were apparently deemed to bring greater prestige to the possessor, see 1Corinthians 14:1-4ff . So, Paul had to remind them that the purpose of all spiritual gifts was to edify the body (in this case, the local church), vv.12,26 , rather than self,  v.4 .  Now, whether we’re giving of our means (by contribution in the assembly, or by charity out of the assembly), praying, showcasing ourselves as godly people, or even leading the assembly in some facet of worship or bible study, if our purpose is to bring attention to ourselves, we’re immature and just doing “spiritual do-nuts”!   The Results of Do-Nuts. We’re not heading into gluttony or obesity here because the subject is still the do-nuts you “do” instead of those you “eat.” But if you think about it, there are some interesting similarities between do-nuts done in a parking lot or on a dirt road, and those done in spiritual terms. In either setting, doing do-nuts:  1) Makes a lot of noise and throws a lot of dust in the air, but accomplishes nothing in practical terms. Thus, they’re all about the “show,” or at least “showing off.” They are the polar opposites of poor in spirit and pure in heart,  Matthew 5:3,8 .  2) Get you nowhere. You’re literally “spinning in circles,” and the only places such will get you is dizzy or in trouble, or both. This was Jesus’ primary point in Matthew 6:1-18 . Whatever notoriety or acclaim is gained from those willing to watch and applaud is all the do-nut doer will get because God is neither served by nor approves of such. As Jesus said, “they have their reward in full,”  vv.2,5,16 .   3) Is destructive. Physically, doing do-nuts ruins the tires, and is tremendously hard on drivetrains. Doing spiritual do-nuts (as described above) fractures fellowships, destroys credibility, and turns what is supposed to be “worship” into “performance art” or a “talent show.” “Worship” is supposed to be the “engine/drivetrain” that moves us closer to God and heaven. Don’t waste it doing do-nuts.  “Doing do-nuts” can be a lot of fun physically or spiritually , if you’re immature and selfish enough to relish excessive noise, dirt in the air, destruction, and showing off instead of moving forward to the destination."],"title":["Spiritual “Do-Nuts”"],"_resultNumber":2,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/spiritual_do_nuts","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":2},{"body":["Change is difficult for most folks, especially major life-altering changes. This is why repentance is probably the most arduous command given us by God. Repentance requires a change of mind that results in a change of heart that leads to a change of activity. But repentance, and the changes it inherently requires, remains a constant challenge for anyone who seeks to grow and mature spiritually because this maturation process demands continual corrections. Some of these “corrections” are at least marginally easier because they involve only minor adjustments to our attitude or activities, but the degree of difficulty certainly increases when more major alterations are required. So, what are the most significant factors that allow, or conversely prevent, these spiritual changes in our lives? While this list is certainly not exhaustive, here are some of the most significant factors…   Desire to please God. It sounds simple, and it is, but unless our desire to please God is stronger than our desire to please ourselves, we will never change. This is true of “major” changes such as becoming a Christian or “changing” religions, as well as more minor changes such as breaking a sinful habit, or becoming more dedicated and diligent in our service to Him. Until we are able to say and mean, “Thy will, and not mine, be done in all things ,” substantive change will remain elusive to us. As long as our choices are based on what pleases us more than on what pleases God, and let’s be clear about this, we are worshipping and serving self rather than God . “For many walk, of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose god is their appetite, and whose glory is in their shame, who set their minds on earthly things,”  Philippians 3:19-20 . If our “choice” of a place or method to worship is based on what pleases us, then we are choosing “our” church rather than His, and we are worshipping “ourselves” rather than Him.   Dedication to God’s Word. Pilate asked Jesus, “What is truth?” in John 18:38 , and apparently intended the question to be rhetorical. But the answer to Pilate’s question is important. Actually, Jesus, surely unbeknownst to Pilate, answered the question in a prayer to His Father in the previous chapter, “Sanctify them in the truth; Thy word is truth,”  John 17:17 . Get that: the Word of God “is” truth. It is not “a” truth among many, nor is it “partly” truth- it “is truth,” period. Therefore, God is the author of that which is true, and this “truth” is revealed to us in His “word.” Now, if we are to be dedicated to God in any kind of realand truesense, we must, therefore, be dedicated to His word. Simple enough. But, how many of us who claim a belief in and allegiance to God are  really dedicated to His word ? Are the major or minor changes in our lives really dictated by God’s word, or by or through some other impetus? Are we willing to change when God’s word dictates such? Or, do we equivocate or evade the truth revealed to us in His word, reverting back to our will and desires, either to avoid change altogether, or justify changes that we are already making that are contrary to Truth? No changes can be made  toward  God unless they are properly founded in dedication  to  His word. Thus, spiritual “changes” are either motivated by our dedication to understanding and applying God’s word, or they are conversely prevented by our lack of dedication to God’s word.   Family ties. The bonds of “family” can motivate changes- either positively toward God, or negatively away from God. Familial relationships can be tremendously strong motivators. Jesus, fully aware that we can easily substitute a desire to please our family for our desire to please God, warned, “He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me,”  Matthew 10:37 . Likewise, our dedication to the truth of God’s word can be easily exchanged for the dedication to family. Again, Jesus emphasized where our true allegiance must lie when, in reference to His own physical family, He chose the spiritual family of those committed to God and His word over them, Matthew 12:46-50 . On the positive side, the godly example and patient teaching of God’s word by our physical families can also help tremendously to motivate our changes to or back to God. The bottom line is this: Our desire to please God must supersede our desire to please our families, and our dedication to the truth of God’s word must overcome any dedication to our families- always.  Change is indeed hard. But everyone can change - if we desire to please God more than ourselves or anyone else, and if we truly dedicate ourselves to understanding and living by the truth of God’s word."],"title":["Why People Change Spiritually….Or Don’t"],"_resultNumber":3,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/why_people_change_spiritually....or_dont","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":3},{"body":["We’ve all heard the cautionary rebuke, “Don’t speak evil of the dead.” Such is probably good advice for a number of reasons: 1) we rarely have sufficient information to issue even a “fair” judgment of their life, cf. 1Samuel 16:7 and 1Corinthians 2:11 ; 2) we certainly don’t have the prerogative to judge their afterlife (eternal destiny), Romans 14:10-12 ; and, 3) we really shouldn’t be “speaking evil” of anyone, living or dead, Ephesians 4:29-32 . But…  There have been a couple of (shall we say) “high profile” deaths recently, which got me to thinking about how we react to death. Perhaps because we’ve heard “Don’t speak evil of the dead” so often, some of us seem to swing the pendulum dramatically the other way. Maybe there are a couple of things with which we need to come to grips.   Unless part of the righteous alive at the return of Christ ( cf. 1Thessalonians 4:17ff ) , everyone will die . God made this reality clear from the beginning, “By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, because from it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return,”  Genesis 3:19 . So, while death is often unexpected at the time, or even tragic in its circumstance, it is a part of life that comes to everyone. Without question, it comes all-too violently and tragically at times. And just as surely, it often comes too soon- before the deceased has prepared for eternity; or too late - after the deceased has done irreparable damage and destruction to others. But none of these realities of death change the fact that everyone dies, and needs to prepare for the judgment which follows, Hebrews 9:27 .   But, when we live contrary to God’s will, and allow ourselves to become enslaved to the evils of this life, no matter what form they take, death is likely to come a whole lot sooner and more tragically than it ought. While such deaths surely may sadden us, they should neither shock nor surprise us, “Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap. For the one who sows to his own flesh shall from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit shall from the Spirit reap eternal life,”  Galatians 6:7-8 . The proverbial writer long ago penned, “the way of transgressors is hard” ( Proverbs 29:6 ), and it’s still true.   Not everyone will go to heaven. This isn’t me “judging” anyone- it’s what Jesus said in Matthew 7:13-14 , “Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide, and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter by it. For the gate is small, and the way is narrow that leads to life, and few are those who find it.” The tendency, it seems, of “not speaking evil of the dead” has evolved into “assuming that anyone/everyone who dies is going to heaven” because we liked, loved, admired, or envied them. Such is simply not the case, as Jesus’ words clearly demonstrate. Our assessments of others- living or dead, does not determine their eternal destiny. God does that. So, while “speaking evil of the dead” is deemed improper, it is no more so than “speaking good of evil people” just because they died. “Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness; who substitute bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and clever in their own sight,”  Isaiah 5:20-21 . “Sinners” don’t become “saints” just because they died.   Being rich, famous, talented, or making people laugh is NOT the criterion by which our lives will be judged.  “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of My Father, who is in heaven,”  Matthew 7:21 . There were surely many rich, famous, and talented people in Jesus’ day who either rejected Him and His gospel, or never got outside of themselves long enough to listen, understand, and obey Him. Whether then, or now, or in whatever future remains, those who “do not know God and… who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus… these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power,”  2Thessalonians 1:8-9 .  I hope these things are not considered to be “speaking evil of the dead,” for such surely was not my intention. However, having a biblically based perspective of life and/or death should never be considered “evil” either."],"title":["Not Speaking Evil of the Dead"],"_resultNumber":4,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/not_speaking_evil_of_the_dead","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":4},{"body":["The Old Testament prophet Amos was a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore figs (not like our figs, but a fig-like fruit that had to be pinched or bruised to ripen), Amos 7:14 . He stepped out of the obscurity of his agrarian way of life to preach a much-needed message of reform to God’s people about 755 years before Christ. Obviously, speaking for God to an apostate people was not something for which his sheep and sycamore trees had prepared him, or was it? Amos was the perfect “man for the job” to deliver a no-nonsense message of repentance or destruction that Israel sorely needed. Their so-called prophets had become ear-ticklers who spoke only the soothing words they wanted to hear. So, God calls Amos to leave his sheep and trees to become what some have called “the first great reformer.” His message from God was largely one of coming destruction because Israel (used of both the northern 10 tribes of Judah and the 2 southern tribes of Israel combined) no longer  walked with God.    Take time to re-read the book of Amos this week. You may be somewhat taken aback at its straightforward approach. This is not a sympathetic, compassionate, loving plea the farmer-turned-prophet delivers for God to Israel. It is a stern rebuke, in no uncertain terms, of apostasy from the standpoint of the justice and righteousness of God . Israel has not walked with God by abiding in the light of His will. But God has commissioned Amos, and he is agreed and walking with God by delivering this message of rebuke and judgment to come. Therefore, the prophet asks, “Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?” (NKJV, Amos 3:3 ). The herdsman farmer didn’t agree or walk with the preachers of the day, but he did agree and walk with God, and this made him the right man of the job! So, what does it take to “walk with God”?     Walking with God   takes, as clearly pointed out by Amos,  agreement with God.  This seems simple enough to appear axiomatic, but we must take it at face value that we cannot disagree with God and still walk with Him. “And this is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth,”  1John 1:5-6 . How is it, then, that many today claim to walk with God and yet disagree with Him about what is and isn’t moral and right? Can we really walk with God while saying that His word is outdated, or somehow no longer applies? Obviously, God does not agreewith this conclusion! “The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God stands forever,”  Isaiah 40:8 . So, we cannot consider what God calls “evil” as being acceptable or “good” (or vice versa) and walk with God , Isaiah 5:20-21 . We can’t walk with God  while  disagreeing with His will!     Walking with God takes,  given the above,  knowledge of God’s word.  Again, this may be somewhat of an oversimplification, but we have to agree with God rather than expecting Him to agree with us. We neither created the world, nor ordained the laws by which it operates- God did. He is the Creator and we are the created, not the other way around. So, for agreement to exist, we must learn and acquiesce to His will/word rather than expecting Him to learn and adapt to our conclusions and will! We cannot, therefore, remake God in our image, or rewrite His laws to suit our tastes. Such is precisely what Romans 1:16-23 calls suppressing “the truth in unrighteousness,” becoming “futile in their speculations,” and being “fools” while “professing to be wise”! So, if we plan to walk with God, we had better get busy “trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord” ( Ephesians 5:10 ) instead of attempting to rewrite the Bible and reorganize Christianity to suit our own purposes, and then expecting Him to be pleased.    Walking with God takes  (are you ready for this?)  walking.  You’re thinking, “Uncanny mastery of the obvious,” right? But please understand that we don’t walk with God by just agreeing with Him and knowing his Will (course/direction), we have to also be actively obedient (walking) . Jesus said it differently, but made the same point in Luke 6:46 , “Why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?” Christianity isn’t about just knowing God’s will and agreeing with Him, but also  doing   His will! Noah “found favor in the eyes of the Lord” because he “was a righteous man, blameless in his time; Noah walked with God,”  Genesis 6:8-9 !  Now, when God says fornication, idolatry, adultery, homosexuality, theft, covetousness, drunkenness, slander, and swindling will keep one from heaven ( 1Corinthians 6:9-10 ), are you going to “walk together” with God, or not? What Amos would say?"],"title":["Walking Together"],"_resultNumber":5,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/walking_together","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":5},{"body":["“Finding a stopping place” can be difficult- like when you sit down to a meal of your absolute favorite food. The “stopping place” is usually the bottom of an empty serving dish. Once you begin, there’s just not a good “stopping place!” Arbitrarily saying, “I’ll go this far, but stop here” is just not an option. The journey is only completed at the finish(ed) line! In much the same way, it ought to be so with our hunger for and application of bible authority. Once we begin to eat this “meat” ( Hebrews 5:12-14 ), we have to continue on to completion because there is just no “stopping point” short of it.  For instance, if we are willing to appeal to the authority of God’s word to understand what’s “right” or “wrong” about one particular issue, how do we then stop short of God’s authority for other matters? If God’s word is the proper authority to determine one issue of morality, why is it not also the right authority to decide all issues of morality? “For whoever keeps the whole law and stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all. For He who said ‘Do not commit adultery,’ also said, ‘Do not commit murder.’ Now if you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law,”  James 2:10-11 . We simply cannot afford to be “picky eaters” or “tasters” of God’s word to determine morality, we have to consume it all.  Let’s take another helping of this same dish. If God’s word is the proper authority to determine issues of morality, how can it possibly be anything less for issues of faith and doctrine (teaching)? When God’s word says there is “one Lord, one faith, and one baptism,” ( Ephesians 4:5 ), how can we say, “Having many differing faiths is a good thing because it allows everyone to find what’s right for them”? Or how can we say, “Baptism is important but not essential”? If having “one Lord” is essential, then so too are “one faith” and “one baptism.”   The same Bible that says murder and adultery are sinful, also says, “Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree, and there be no divisions among you, but you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment,”  1Corinthians 1:10 . It also says, “For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit,”  1Corinthians 12:13 . The only way we can be “one body” is to all eat and drink fully of the authority of God’s word.  We cannot appeal to our own thoughts and ideas for such is “self-made religion” ( Colossians 2:23 ), and making a “god” of our own “appetites” ( Philippians 3:19 ). Neither can we appeal to the thinking of modern culture for authority because 1Corinthians 1:21 is still true, “….the world through its wisdom did not come to know God….” But, we also cannot be true to God while appealing to uninspired the writings of men, whether new or ancient, as the basis of authority. Jesus condemns this in Matthew 15:6-9 , “And thus you invalidate the word of God for the sake of your tradition…. This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far away from Me. But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men.” There is just no stopping place with appealing to the authority of God’s word short of the bottom of the dish!  Here is one final “helping” of this authority dish. We cannot appeal to the authority of God’s word to determine issues of morality, faith, and doctrine without also allowing it to be the standard for our worship (collectively praising God). Please read your New Testament. It is the authoritative standard for Christ’s church. The Old Testament scriptures were the authoritative standard for Jews living prior to the death of Jesus (see Exodus 20:22 ; 2Corinthians 3:7-11 ; Hebrews 9:1-17 ), but the “gospel of the kingdom” of Jesus Christ is the sole authority for all men everywhere today, Luke 16:16 ; 2Thessalonians 2:14 . To worship and please Him, we must do so in the ways and with the means He provides in the authority of His Law. If it isn’t in the New Testament, it can’t be New Testament worship. If we are willing to appeal to the New Testament to determine issues of morality, faith, and doctrine, shouldn’t we also be willing to look to it for authority in worship?  The only “stopping place” to be found with regard to the authority of Jesus Christ is “all the way.” We simply cannot “pick and choose” the parts of His law we are willing accept- we must take and consume/apply it all!"],"title":["Finding a Stopping Place"],"_resultNumber":6,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/finding_a_stopping_place","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":6},{"body":["The book of Proverbs has much to say about complacency ( cf. 6:6-11 ; 24:30-34 ; 26:13-16 ; e.g. ); and there are likewise N.T. passages dealing with the subjectboth indirectly and directly , Ephesians 4:28 ; 6:5-9 ; 2Thessalonians 3:6-12 . Laziness, or slothfulness, is typically easy to spot and generally disdained- though probably not nearly so much so in the last several years when “entitlement” has become more the mindset of many. However, the aversion to good, hard, honest work usually has other manifestations besides just wanting to get paid and supported for doing little or nothing. This mentality also affects our  spiritual  willingness to work. Consider carefully these examples:   Some don’t want to “work” to be saved. Though it is certainly true that we cannot “earn” our salvation by piling up invoices of meritorious works, Ephesians 2:8-9 , this does  not  mean that there is nothing to be done on our part in order to receive it. “And why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?” These are the words of Jesus in Luke 6:46 . In giving the Great Commission, Jesus also said, “He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved….”  Mark 16:16 . The crucifiers of Jesus, after becoming believers in Him, asked, “Brethren, what shall we do ?” They were not told to “Just believe and accept Jesus,” or to just “feel” or “experience” anything. They were told to do something, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins…”  Acts 2:37-38 . Indeed, “faith without works is useless” and “dead,”  James 2:20,26 . Spiritual laziness doesn’t accomplish salvation. Likewise,   Some don’t want to “work” to remain saved. “Once saved, always saved” may be popular, but it is just not what the New Testament teaches. Please note that Peter warned against falling away, “You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your guard lest, being carried away by the error of unprincipled men, you fall from your own steadfastness,”  2Peter.3:17 . Hebrews 3:12 adds, “Take care, brethren, lest there should be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart, in falling away from the living God.” The very thing that many say cannot happen ( i.e. falling away/losing salvation/falling from grace ) is further stated to have occurred to some of the brethren in Galatia, “You have been severed from Christ….you have fallen from grace,”  Galatians 5:4 . Salvation, once attained by faith and obedience to the gospel, must be maintained with diligent and consistent effort. There is just no other way to accurately understand James 5:19-20 and Philippians 2:12-16 . But,   Some don’t want to “work” to grow and mature as Christians either. Our conversion to Christ by faith and baptism is not the end, it is a beginning from which we are supposed to grow, mature, and bear fruit to the Lord, 2Peter 3:18 ; John 15:1-2 . But this process of maturation takes a lot of diligent effort! While others can help to “water” the new plant ( cf. 1Corinthians 3:6-8a ), “each will receive his own reward according to his own labor ,”  v.8b ! To mix metaphors, Christians that only consume what they are bottle and spoon-fed usually become spiritually lazy and remain perpetually immature, cf. Hebrews 5:11 – 6:2 . To illustrate this point, if you do not already know what the passages that are referenced but not quoted in this article say, did you look them up “to see whether these things were so,”  Acts 17:11 ? All too often, spiritually lazy Christians attend a couple of one-hour services a month when it is convenient to them, rarely open a Bible while there, and never seriously study it otherwise, and yet claim to be “holding fast the word of life,”  Philippians 2:16 . Congregations provide multiple services to educate and edify each week that are poorly attended by their own members. Capable bible class teachers diligently prepare lessons that are left in the pews or classrooms unconsidered even by many who do attend them. Christian parents who say they want their children to become Christians rarely bring them to bible class, or study the Bible at home with them. Why? Spiritual laziness is surely the problem (or at least one of them).  What is the solution? “But, beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and things that accompany salvation, though we are speaking in this way. For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints. And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end, that you may not be sluggish , but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises,”  Hebrews 6:11-12 ."],"title":["Spiritual Laziness"],"_resultNumber":7,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/spiritual_laziness","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":7},{"body":["This quiz has only one problem to solve: Bible + ______________ = Christian.   Since most people prefer “multiple choice” to “fill in the blank” questions, here are some possible answers: A) Creed; B) Grace ; C)  Faith ; or, D)  Obedience . Please take a moment to think about your answer before reading further.   A) Creed. Creeds are man-authored documents meant as statements of faith that wind up dividing potential bible-believers along denominational lines. For instance, if one who seeks to adhere to the Bible plus the Catechism, he becomes a Catholic. Likewise, if he takes the Bible plus the Manual, he becomes a Baptist; and if he takes the Bible but adds the Discipline, he winds up a Methodist, etc. But, and this is vitally important, the Bible alone will not make one a member of a denomination- it takes the Bible plus devotion to a man-authored creed to make a denominational member, cf. Matthew 15:1-9 .   B) Grace. The grace of God (somewhat simplistically, but adequate for our purposes here, defined as “unmerited favor/good will”) is absolutely essential to becoming a Christian. But note Titus 2:11 , “For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,” . Are “all men” saved? If the Bible plus God’s grace is all that it takes to become a Christian, then the answer would have to be “yes.” But notice that the sentence in Titus 2:11 regarding “the grace of God” continued in the following verses, “For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in this present age…” The grace of God that brought salvation did so in the form of  instructions  (and the redemptive sacrifice of Jesus, v.14 )! Instructions are only beneficial if they are followed. So, the Bible plus God’s grace alone does not a Christian make. If the Bible- given by inspiration to man, plus grace- given by God to man, equals salvation as a Christian, then man has no input or participation in his own salvation. But this “God only” salvation completely contradicts what Jesus had to say about the matter in Matthew 25:31-46 !   C) Faith. The faith of man is absolutely essential to becoming a Christian. Not only is it the foundation of our conviction and hope,  Hebrews 11:1 , and “without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him,”  Hebrews 11:6 . However, this is very different from “faith only” salvation. The only place in the N.T. that the words “faith” and “only” appear together is James 2:24 (KJV) “Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.” In fact, Jesus said that even faith was itself a work, John 6:28-29 . Therefore, it is impossible for salvation to be by faith alone with no mixture of works whatsoever because faith is itself a work. “Faith only” no more equals salvation than did “God only” salvation. The Bible plus faith is where one begins to become a Christian, but is surely not all there is to the matter.   D) Obedience. Finally, here is the correct answer. How so? Man’s obedience does not nullify God’s grace, because as we saw from Titus 2:11-12 , the grace of God brought salvation to manin the form of instructions, and instructions are only beneficial when obeyed. Neither does man’s obedience negate faith, for as we saw from Hebrews 11:6 , in order for man’s faith to be pleasing to God, and thus be rewarded by Him, it must lead him to seek God. How does man by faith seek God? Listen closely to Jesus’ words from Matthew 7:21 , “Not every one who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of My Father, who is in heaven.”   So, the Bible (God’s instructions by grace) + Obedience (man’s faith in action) = Christian (those saved by Christ). In some ways, this is a simple restatement of 1John 2:3 , “And by this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments.”"],"title":["Spiritual Math Quiz"],"_resultNumber":8,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/spiritual_math_quiz","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":8},{"body":["(As a preacher for about thirty years, I’ve spent considerable time in hospitals- as a patient, and with friends, family, and brethren. While writing this particular article, I am “the night shift” in an Austin, TX, ICU with a friend who had five bypasses of vessels around his heart earlier today. But, it’s about midnight; he’s had a full dose of pain meds, and is doing well according to all of his monitors, his nurse, and his snoring.) Some experiences are purely for entertainment purposes, and “fun” is the only real object. But most of the rest of our encounters hold at least the possibility for lessons to be learned, through reflective observation, that can enrich and benefit future occasions. Even hospitals contain significant opportunities to learn things about life and the human experience of it.  Hospitals are places of paradoxes and contrasts. There are births that bring the giddy excitement of new beginnings, and there are deaths- both as sweet releases from the pain and agonies of physical burdens of life itself, and the traumatic taking of it all too soon which seemingly rips the hearts out of families and friends. In between the beginnings and the ends experienced at hospitals, there you also witness the full range of human emotion. Everything from the nervous anticipation of good news, to the worried dread for expected bad news, and all points in between, are typically in full view. Excuse the expressions, but hospitals are indeed a “slice of life,” and of death.  But aside from the paradoxes of these realizations and finalities, hospitals also tend to bring out the best, and worst, of people. Staff members can be incredibly caring, generous, gracious, and tender; and patients and their worried families can be terribly inconsiderate, rude, demanding, and self-centered. And of course, all of those attitudes and roles can sometimes be reversed! These things are to be expected since some people are at their best when things are at their worst, and some people are at their worst when things are not the best. All in all, hospitals provide tangible demonstrations of who we really are- inside, the person beyond whatever façade we typically put forth on a normal day-to-day basis. Here’s how….   Hospitals (meaning more specifically the situations and circumstances which occur in them) provide opportunities for true empathy. “Sympathy” is basically feel sorry “for” someone, whereas “empathy” entails being so open and receptive to what they are feeling or experiencing that you feel and experience it with them. Perhaps such is what is described in 1Samuel 18: 1, where it says “the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as himself.”    Hospitals provide opportunities for true compassion. Born of empathy, “compassion” motivates the possessor to act in order to alleviate whatever circumstance evoked the empathetic emotions in the first place. In other words, compassion helps, at least as much as possible, to improve the condition of others. In the parable of “The Good Samaritan” Jesus relayed in Luke 10:30-37 , both the priest and the Levite saw the pitiful condition of the man who had been beaten, robbed, and left to die, and perhaps had sympathy for him, but had no empathy with or compassion for him, and thus passed by without rendering any aid. But the Samaritan, upon seeing this man’s pitiful condition, empathized with him, and felt a compassion for him that prompted both immediate and sustained care for him.   Hospitals provide opportunities for true kindness. In hospitals, for the most part, people are just nicer to one another, more polite, more gracious, and more human . Even complete strangers exchange looks and simple words of greetings and encouragement full of good emotions and thoughts based in hope and well wishes. While this is probably due to the commonality of pain and suffering (physical and/or emotional), wouldn’t it be great if we always felt about and treated one another everywhere the way we do in hospitals? Consider 1Peter 3:8-9 in these regards, “To sum up, let all be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kind-hearted, and humble in spirit, not returning evil for evil, or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing.”   There are, however, a couple of parting points to add to these things. One, surely we can do a better job of manifesting the best of who we are outside of hospitals and all the time. And two, churches are supposed to be hospitals for the spirit of man- performing spiritual healing just as hospitals heal the body. Let’s remember that purpose and function accordingly."],"title":["Hospital Reflective Observations"],"_resultNumber":9,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/hospital_reflective_observations","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":9},{"body":["Change is difficult for most folks, especially major life-altering changes. This is why repentance is probably the most arduous command given us by God. Repentance requires a change of mind that results in a change of heart that leads to a change of activity. But repentance, and the changes it inherently requires, remains a constant challenge for anyone who seeks to grow and mature spiritually because this maturation process demands continual corrections. Some of these “corrections” are at least marginally easier because they involve only minor adjustments to our attitude or activities, but the degree of difficulty certainly increases when more major alterations are required. So, what are the most significant factors that allow, or conversely prevent, these spiritual changes in our lives? While this list is certainly not exhaustive, here are some of the most significant factors…   Desire to please God. It sounds simple, and it is, but unless our desire to please God is stronger than our desire to please ourselves, we will never change. This is true of “major” changes such as becoming a Christian or “changing” religions, as well as more minor changes such as breaking a sinful habit, or becoming more dedicated and diligent in our service to Him. Until we are able to say and mean, “Thy will, and not mine, be done in all things ,” substantive change will remain elusive to us. As long as our choices are based on what pleases us more than on what pleases God, and let’s be clear about this, we are worshipping and serving self rather than God . “For many walk, of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose god is their appetite, and whose glory is in their shame, who set their minds on earthly things,”  Philippians 3:19-20 . If our “choice” of a place or method to worship is based on what pleases us, then we are choosing “our” church rather than His, and we are worshipping “ourselves” rather than Him.   Dedication to God’s Word. Pilate asked Jesus, “What is truth?” in John 18:38 , and apparently intended the question to be rhetorical. But the answer to Pilate’s question is important. Actually, Jesus, surely unbeknownst to Pilate, answered the question in a prayer to His Father in the previous chapter, “Sanctify them in the truth; Thy word is truth,”  John 17:17 . Get that: the Word of God “is” truth. It is not “a” truth among many, nor is it “partly” truth- it “is truth,” period. Therefore, God is the author of that which is true, and this “truth” is revealed to us in His “word.” Now, if we are to be dedicated to God in any kind of realand truesense, we must, therefore, be dedicated to His word. Simple enough. But, how many of us who claim a belief in and allegiance to God are  really dedicated to His word ? Are the major or minor changes in our lives really dictated by God’s word, or by or through some other impetus? Are we willing to change when God’s word dictates such? Or, do we equivocate or evade the truth revealed to us in His word, reverting back to our will and desires, either to avoid change altogether, or justify changes that we are already making that are contrary to Truth? No changes can be made  toward  God unless they are properly founded in dedication  to  His word. Thus, spiritual “changes” are either motivated by our dedication to understanding and applying God’s word, or they are conversely prevented by our lack of dedication to God’s word.   Family ties. The bonds of “family” can motivate changes- either positively toward God, or negatively away from God. Familial relationships can be tremendously strong motivators. Jesus, fully aware that we can easily substitute a desire to please our family for our desire to please God, warned, “He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me,”  Matthew 10:37 . Likewise, our dedication to the truth of God’s word can be easily exchanged for the dedication to family. Again, Jesus emphasized where our true allegiance must lie when, in reference to His own physical family, He chose the spiritual family of those committed to God and His word over them, Matthew 12:46-50 . On the positive side, the godly example and patient teaching of God’s word by our physical families can also help tremendously to motivate our changes to or back to God. The bottom line is this: Our desire to please God must supersede our desire to please our families, and our dedication to the truth of God’s word must overcome any dedication to our families- always.  Change is indeed hard. But everyone can change - if we desire to please God more than ourselves or anyone else, and if we truly dedicate ourselves to understanding and living by the truth of God’s word.","We’ve all heard the cautionary rebuke, “Don’t speak evil of the dead.” Such is probably good advice for a number of reasons: 1) we rarely have sufficient information to issue even a “fair” judgment of their life, cf. 1Samuel 16:7 and 1Corinthians 2:11 ; 2) we certainly don’t have the prerogative to judge their afterlife (eternal destiny), Romans 14:10-12 ; and, 3) we really shouldn’t be “speaking evil” of anyone, living or dead, Ephesians 4:29-32 . But…  There have been a couple of (shall we say) “high profile” deaths recently, which got me to thinking about how we react to death. Perhaps because we’ve heard “Don’t speak evil of the dead” so often, some of us seem to swing the pendulum dramatically the other way. Maybe there are a couple of things with which we need to come to grips.   Unless part of the righteous alive at the return of Christ ( cf. 1Thessalonians 4:17ff ) , everyone will die . God made this reality clear from the beginning, “By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, because from it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return,”  Genesis 3:19 . So, while death is often unexpected at the time, or even tragic in its circumstance, it is a part of life that comes to everyone. Without question, it comes all-too violently and tragically at times. And just as surely, it often comes too soon- before the deceased has prepared for eternity; or too late - after the deceased has done irreparable damage and destruction to others. But none of these realities of death change the fact that everyone dies, and needs to prepare for the judgment which follows, Hebrews 9:27 .   But, when we live contrary to God’s will, and allow ourselves to become enslaved to the evils of this life, no matter what form they take, death is likely to come a whole lot sooner and more tragically than it ought. While such deaths surely may sadden us, they should neither shock nor surprise us, “Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap. For the one who sows to his own flesh shall from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit shall from the Spirit reap eternal life,”  Galatians 6:7-8 . The proverbial writer long ago penned, “the way of transgressors is hard” ( Proverbs 29:6 ), and it’s still true.   Not everyone will go to heaven. This isn’t me “judging” anyone- it’s what Jesus said in Matthew 7:13-14 , “Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide, and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter by it. For the gate is small, and the way is narrow that leads to life, and few are those who find it.” The tendency, it seems, of “not speaking evil of the dead” has evolved into “assuming that anyone/everyone who dies is going to heaven” because we liked, loved, admired, or envied them. Such is simply not the case, as Jesus’ words clearly demonstrate. Our assessments of others- living or dead, does not determine their eternal destiny. God does that. So, while “speaking evil of the dead” is deemed improper, it is no more so than “speaking good of evil people” just because they died. “Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness; who substitute bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and clever in their own sight,”  Isaiah 5:20-21 . “Sinners” don’t become “saints” just because they died.   Being rich, famous, talented, or making people laugh is NOT the criterion by which our lives will be judged.  “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of My Father, who is in heaven,”  Matthew 7:21 . There were surely many rich, famous, and talented people in Jesus’ day who either rejected Him and His gospel, or never got outside of themselves long enough to listen, understand, and obey Him. Whether then, or now, or in whatever future remains, those who “do not know God and… who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus… these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power,”  2Thessalonians 1:8-9 .  I hope these things are not considered to be “speaking evil of the dead,” for such surely was not my intention. However, having a biblically based perspective of life and/or death should never be considered “evil” either.","This quiz has only one problem to solve: Bible + ______________ = Christian.

In some ways, this is a simple restatement of 1John 2:3 , “And by this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments.”","The title is not suggestive of some sort of “religious” circular dough that has been deep-fried and sprinkled or glazed with sugar, though there are probably points to be made along those lines also. Instead, the “do-nut” under consideration is the type done with a motorized vehicle- the kind where the front wheels barely move in a tight circle and the back wheels are spinning and squealing in a larger smoking or dirt-slinging circle around the outside. These “do-nuts” have definite comparisons to some “spiritual” pursuits today…   The Purpose of Do-Nuts. Any teenager, or adult acting like one, does a “do-nut” for one or more of a couple of reasons: 1) To show off or gain attention seems to be a primary purpose; 2) to exhibit power, which is closely tied to the previous; and/or, 3) to leave circular black marks on the pavement, or deep groves in the dirt, in tribute to purposes 1 and 2.  The spiritually immature do “religious do-nuts” for the same reasons. Some activities are perhaps “performed” under the guise of benefiting others, but are really just efforts to gain attention for oneself. A couple of NT examples should help to clarify. In Matthew 6:1 , Jesus warned His disciples against doing spiritual do-nuts when He said, “Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.” He then went on to provide three specific examples: giving alms to be seen by others, vv.2-4 ; praying to be seen (or heard) by others, vv.5-15 ; and fasting to be seen by others, vv.16-18 .  However, the activities done “to be noticed” by others are not limited to giving, praying, or how we present ourselves. In the church at Corinth, certain spiritual gifts were more highly sought than others because they were apparently deemed to bring greater prestige to the possessor, see 1Corinthians 14:1-4ff . So, Paul had to remind them that the purpose of all spiritual gifts was to edify the body (in this case, the local church), vv.12,26 , rather than self,  v.4 .  Now, whether we’re giving of our means (by contribution in the assembly, or by charity out of the assembly), praying, showcasing ourselves as godly people, or even leading the assembly in some facet of worship or bible study, if our purpose is to bring attention to ourselves, we’re immature and just doing “spiritual do-nuts”!   The Results of Do-Nuts. We’re not heading into gluttony or obesity here because the subject is still the do-nuts you “do” instead of those you “eat.” But if you think about it, there are some interesting similarities between do-nuts done in a parking lot or on a dirt road, and those done in spiritual terms. In either setting, doing do-nuts:  1) Makes a lot of noise and throws a lot of dust in the air, but accomplishes nothing in practical terms. Thus, they’re all about the “show,” or at least “showing off.” They are the polar opposites of poor in spirit and pure in heart,  Matthew 5:3,8 .  2) Get you nowhere. You’re literally “spinning in circles,” and the only places such will get you is dizzy or in trouble, or both. This was Jesus’ primary point in Matthew 6:1-18 . Whatever notoriety or acclaim is gained from those willing to watch and applaud is all the do-nut doer will get because God is neither served by nor approves of such. As Jesus said, “they have their reward in full,”  vv.2,5,16 .   3) Is destructive. Physically, doing do-nuts ruins the tires, and is tremendously hard on drivetrains. Doing spiritual do-nuts (as described above) fractures fellowships, destroys credibility, and turns what is supposed to be “worship” into “performance art” or a “talent show.” “Worship” is supposed to be the “engine/drivetrain” that moves us closer to God and heaven. Don’t waste it doing do-nuts.  “Doing do-nuts” can be a lot of fun physically or spiritually , if you’re immature and selfish enough to relish excessive noise, dirt in the air, destruction, and showing off instead of moving forward to the destination.","In writing, hyphens are often used to combine ( compound ) or divide words. Interestingly enough, they work pretty much the same way in people. Though we use them in an effort to combine two names or descriptions into one, they often wind up being more divisive than anything else. For instance…   In marriage, names are sometimes hyphenated. Presumably, this is done to allow the retaining and incorporation of the wife’s family name. Sometimes, the husband even adopts this new hyphenated last name also as a show of support and solidarity. Thus, rather than being the Jones family, the new couple becomes the Smith-Jones family. In time, Mr. and Mrs. Smith-Jones produce offspring, also duly saddled with the double moniker, Smith-Jones. But here’s where this plan goes off the rails. What if little Johnny Smith-Jones grows up and decides to marry Susie Jones-Smith (whose parents had the same idea)? Is their forth-coming little bundle of joy to be Billy Smith-Jones-Jones-Smith? Let alone the possibility that little Billy grows up to marry a quadruple-hyphenated girl!  Besides the potential mess illustrated above, is there actually anything biblically wrong with hyphenated marriages? Perhaps not, but the Bible does say that a man “shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh,”  Genesis 2:23 ; Matthew 19:4-5 . While these passages admittedly say nothing of name sharing directly, they do command that the couple become “one flesh.” Surely such includes the sexual union, but it is much more. “One flesh” means that they become one couple, rather than two separate individuals trying to retain their former individuality while trying to be one,  cf. Ephesians 5:28-32 . If they are going to share a life, and be one couple, shouldn’t they also share one name?   Nationalities are increasingly hyphenated. As in marriage, this has become more popular in recent years. Many are not content with being an “American,” but feel the need to put some other country before it with a hyphen between, as in “Xxxxxxx-American.” This is often done despite the fact that neither they, nor any ancestor they can identify, ever resided in the other country. While it may be just an effort of taking pride in heritages by combining them, this insistence on a hyphenated nationality can also divide the country by emphasizing our differences rather than uniting under a common flag. It actually highlights, as did marriage, the problem of split allegiances.   Yes, America is a “land of immigrants,” and “the melting pot of the world.” But, one of the things that previously made this country great was that immigrants wanted to be, first and foremost, “Americans.” They were willing to leave their country of origin, endure tremendous hardships to get here, then learn a new language and new customs, and start over by adopting a new nationality. They wanted to be “Americans,” not a hyphenated hybrid of such. Biblically and otherwise, names are important because they both describe relationships and reflect allegiances, cf.1Peter 2:9-10 . But perhaps most importantly,   Religious Affiliations are all-too-often hyphenated. Few are content, it seems, with being just a “Christian,” opting instead for “ insert denominational name of choice -Christian.” The problem is, no denominational names were used to describe and delineate disciples in the New Testament. They were just “Christians”- so no hyphens were needed, “…and the disciples were first called Christians…”  Acts 11:26 . In fact, Paul condemned the idea of Christians trying to maintain any sort of dual allegiance (with Christ and any man) in 1Corinthians 1:12-13 , “…each one of you is saying, ‘I am of Paul,’ and ‘I of Apollos,’ and ‘I of Cephas,’ and ‘I of Christ.’ Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?” Although no hyphens were literally used then, the practice denounced is the same as what some are doing now- dividing the body of Christ and failing to be of “the same mind” and “the same judgment,”  1Corinthians 1:10 ! Why would anyone do such a thing? Misplaced loyalties and split allegiances are again the problem, just as was the case with marriage and nationality. We cannot be hyphenated Christians. Anything hyphenated with Christ(ian) is too much, and fails to maintain the sole loyalty and allegiance demanded, Matthew 4:10 ; Acts 5:29 !   Words must sometimes be combined or divided by a hyphen for good reasons, but hyphens do far more to divide, rather than combine, people  .","The Old Testament prophet Amos was a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore figs (not like our figs, but a fig-like fruit that had to be pinched or bruised to ripen), Amos 7:14 . He stepped out of the obscurity of his agrarian way of life to preach a much-needed message of reform to God’s people about 755 years before Christ. Obviously, speaking for God to an apostate people was not something for which his sheep and sycamore trees had prepared him, or was it? Amos was the perfect “man for the job” to deliver a no-nonsense message of repentance or destruction that Israel sorely needed. Their so-called prophets had become ear-ticklers who spoke only the soothing words they wanted to hear. So, God calls Amos to leave his sheep and trees to become what some have called “the first great reformer.” His message from God was largely one of coming destruction because Israel (used of both the northern 10 tribes of Judah and the 2 southern tribes of Israel combined) no longer  walked with God.    Take time to re-read the book of Amos this week. You may be somewhat taken aback at its straightforward approach. This is not a sympathetic, compassionate, loving plea the farmer-turned-prophet delivers for God to Israel. It is a stern rebuke, in no uncertain terms, of apostasy from the standpoint of the justice and righteousness of God . Israel has not walked with God by abiding in the light of His will. But God has commissioned Amos, and he is agreed and walking with God by delivering this message of rebuke and judgment to come. Therefore, the prophet asks, “Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?” (NKJV, Amos 3:3 ). The herdsman farmer didn’t agree or walk with the preachers of the day, but he did agree and walk with God, and this made him the right man of the job! So, what does it take to “walk with God”?     Walking with God   takes, as clearly pointed out by Amos,  agreement with God.  This seems simple enough to appear axiomatic, but we must take it at face value that we cannot disagree with God and still walk with Him. “And this is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth,”  1John 1:5-6 . How is it, then, that many today claim to walk with God and yet disagree with Him about what is and isn’t moral and right? Can we really walk with God while saying that His word is outdated, or somehow no longer applies? Obviously, God does not agreewith this conclusion! “The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God stands forever,”  Isaiah 40:8 . So, we cannot consider what God calls “evil” as being acceptable or “good” (or vice versa) and walk with God , Isaiah 5:20-21 . We can’t walk with God  while  disagreeing with His will!     Walking with God takes,  given the above,  knowledge of God’s word.  Again, this may be somewhat of an oversimplification, but we have to agree with God rather than expecting Him to agree with us. We neither created the world, nor ordained the laws by which it operates- God did. He is the Creator and we are the created, not the other way around. So, for agreement to exist, we must learn and acquiesce to His will/word rather than expecting Him to learn and adapt to our conclusions and will! We cannot, therefore, remake God in our image, or rewrite His laws to suit our tastes. Such is precisely what Romans 1:16-23 calls suppressing “the truth in unrighteousness,” becoming “futile in their speculations,” and being “fools” while “professing to be wise”! So, if we plan to walk with God, we had better get busy “trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord” ( Ephesians 5:10 ) instead of attempting to rewrite the Bible and reorganize Christianity to suit our own purposes, and then expecting Him to be pleased.    Walking with God takes  (are you ready for this?)  walking.  You’re thinking, “Uncanny mastery of the obvious,” right? But please understand that we don’t walk with God by just agreeing with Him and knowing his Will (course/direction), we have to also be actively obedient (walking) . Jesus said it differently, but made the same point in Luke 6:46 , “Why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?” Christianity isn’t about just knowing God’s will and agreeing with Him, but also  doing   His will! Noah “found favor in the eyes of the Lord” because he “was a righteous man, blameless in his time; Noah walked with God,”  Genesis 6:8-9 !  Now, when God says fornication, idolatry, adultery, homosexuality, theft, covetousness, drunkenness, slander, and swindling will keep one from heaven ( 1Corinthians 6:9-10 ), are you going to “walk together” with God, or not? What Amos would say?","(As a preacher for about thirty years, I’ve spent considerable time in hospitals- as a patient, and with friends, family, and brethren. While writing this particular article, I am “the night shift” in an Austin, TX, ICU with a friend who had five bypasses of vessels around his heart earlier today. But, it’s about midnight; he’s had a full dose of pain meds, and is doing well according to all of his monitors, his nurse, and his snoring.) Some experiences are purely for entertainment purposes, and “fun” is the only real object. But most of the rest of our encounters hold at least the possibility for lessons to be learned, through reflective observation, that can enrich and benefit future occasions. Even hospitals contain significant opportunities to learn things about life and the human experience of it.  Hospitals are places of paradoxes and contrasts. There are births that bring the giddy excitement of new beginnings, and there are deaths- both as sweet releases from the pain and agonies of physical burdens of life itself, and the traumatic taking of it all too soon which seemingly rips the hearts out of families and friends. In between the beginnings and the ends experienced at hospitals, there you also witness the full range of human emotion. Everything from the nervous anticipation of good news, to the worried dread for expected bad news, and all points in between, are typically in full view. Excuse the expressions, but hospitals are indeed a “slice of life,” and of death.  But aside from the paradoxes of these realizations and finalities, hospitals also tend to bring out the best, and worst, of people. Staff members can be incredibly caring, generous, gracious, and tender; and patients and their worried families can be terribly inconsiderate, rude, demanding, and self-centered. And of course, all of those attitudes and roles can sometimes be reversed! These things are to be expected since some people are at their best when things are at their worst, and some people are at their worst when things are not the best. All in all, hospitals provide tangible demonstrations of who we really are- inside, the person beyond whatever façade we typically put forth on a normal day-to-day basis. Here’s how….   Hospitals (meaning more specifically the situations and circumstances which occur in them) provide opportunities for true empathy. “Sympathy” is basically feel sorry “for” someone, whereas “empathy” entails being so open and receptive to what they are feeling or experiencing that you feel and experience it with them. Perhaps such is what is described in 1Samuel 18: 1, where it says “the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as himself.”    Hospitals provide opportunities for true compassion. Born of empathy, “compassion” motivates the possessor to act in order to alleviate whatever circumstance evoked the empathetic emotions in the first place. In other words, compassion helps, at least as much as possible, to improve the condition of others. In the parable of “The Good Samaritan” Jesus relayed in Luke 10:30-37 , both the priest and the Levite saw the pitiful condition of the man who had been beaten, robbed, and left to die, and perhaps had sympathy for him, but had no empathy with or compassion for him, and thus passed by without rendering any aid. But the Samaritan, upon seeing this man’s pitiful condition, empathized with him, and felt a compassion for him that prompted both immediate and sustained care for him.   Hospitals provide opportunities for true kindness. In hospitals, for the most part, people are just nicer to one another, more polite, more gracious, and more human . Even complete strangers exchange looks and simple words of greetings and encouragement full of good emotions and thoughts based in hope and well wishes. While this is probably due to the commonality of pain and suffering (physical and/or emotional), wouldn’t it be great if we always felt about and treated one another everywhere the way we do in hospitals? Consider 1Peter 3:8-9 in these regards, “To sum up, let all be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kind-hearted, and humble in spirit, not returning evil for evil, or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing.”   There are, however, a couple of parting points to add to these things. One, surely we can do a better job of manifesting the best of who we are outside of hospitals and all the time. And two, churches are supposed to be hospitals for the spirit of man- performing spiritual healing just as hospitals heal the body. Let’s remember that purpose and function accordingly.","“Handling accurately the word of truth” ( 2Timothy 2:15 ) is about more than just being able to “rightly divide” (the KJV translation) between the Old and New Testaments. It also has to do with using a verse in the right way, rather than taking it out of context and forcing an application from it that is not under consideration in the framework of the passage where it is found. Let’s examine some common examples….   Matthew 18:20 , “For where two or three have gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst.” This passage is sometimes used to buttress the resolve of those assembling to worship no matter how few attend. Though I have no doubts that even two or three who sincerely gather for the purpose of worship evoke the approval and spiritual presence of the Lord, such is not really the meaning of this passage. Jesus has been addressing how to return an erring brother back to spiritual safety, cf. v.15 ; or if he refuses to repent, how to regard and treat him, cf. vv.16-17 . Then, in vv.18-19 , He emphasizes the importance of there being corroborating testimony from multiple, credible witnesses who are in agreement that sin has indeed been committed. So, the gathering together in v.20 is not about worship, but rather an agreed upon assessment of sin, v.16 ; and the proper course of action to be taken in light of inspiration,  vv.18-19  . See? Using a passage out of context is not “handling accurately the word of truth.”    1Corinthians 15:33 , “Do not be deceived: Bad company corrupts good morals.” This verse is often used to stress to young people the importance of “picking good friends.” Again, I completely concur with the wisdom of the principle involved, as such is clearly taught in Proverbs 13:20 , but this is just not the point Paul is making here to the Corinthians. The context of 1Corinthians 15:12 reveals that there were some among the church at Corinth who believed and taught that “there is no resurrection of the dead.” So, beginning at v.13 , and proceeding through to the end of the chapter, Paul shows this doctrine to be false. It is in this context that we find v.33 . The objects of the admonition are not adolescents, they’re adult church members! And, the bad company to which Paul refers is not heathen teenagers, but false teachers within a local church. Spiritually needed principles have a right passage behind them- let’s use it (or them) instead of lifting one from its context that has little, if anything, to do with the principle we’re trying to emphasize.   Matthew 7:1 , “Do not judge lest you be judged yourselves.” This passage is typically used toward someone who has just issued some form of condemnation or correction. So, the offender responds with this passage, or some other form of “you can’t judge me.” While it is true that no human will judge another’s eternal destiny- God will do so, such is clearly not the meaning or import of this passage. Note that vv.2-5 make it clear that hypocritical judgment/condemnationis under consideration, not corrective judgment/condemnation . But even more specifically, does anyone actually believe that: 1) not judging is even possible; or, 2) that such would actually excuse one from his own eternal judgment? Jesus actually commanded righteous judgment, John 7:24 . We cannot fulfill our duties to one another without judging- otherwise, how would we know and help one who “is caught in any trespass,” and “restore such a one,”  Galatians 6:1 ? Or, how could we follow His instructions in Matthew 18:15ff as mentioned above? The passage in Matthew 7:1  does prohibit hypocritical judgment or condemnation, but does not remove the responsibility that each of us has to help one another “see” and turn from sin. Surely, using a verse in an effort to validate a false principle is “misusing” it, and is not “handling accurately the word of truth.”   It is always important to use the right passage to make the right point(s), but an additional danger associated with misusing a verse is that when we do so, we rarely “get” the real point being made by the verse within its context. “All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteous” ( 2Timothy 3:16 ), but its benefit of making us “adequate, equipped for every good work” ( 2Timothy 3:17 ) is dependent upon our “handling it accurately”! By all means, preach and teach the Word both publicly and from house to house, but do so without distorting the Scriptures ( 2Peter 3:16 ).","The book of Proverbs has much to say about complacency ( cf. 6:6-11 ; 24:30-34 ; 26:13-16 ; e.g. ); and there are likewise N.T. passages dealing with the subjectboth indirectly and directly , Ephesians 4:28 ; 6:5-9 ; 2Thessalonians 3:6-12 . Laziness, or slothfulness, is typically easy to spot and generally disdained- though probably not nearly so much so in the last several years when “entitlement” has become more the mindset of many. However, the aversion to good, hard, honest work usually has other manifestations besides just wanting to get paid and supported for doing little or nothing. This mentality also affects our  spiritual  willingness to work. Consider carefully these examples:   Some don’t want to “work” to be saved. Though it is certainly true that we cannot “earn” our salvation by piling up invoices of meritorious works, Ephesians 2:8-9 , this does  not  mean that there is nothing to be done on our part in order to receive it. “And why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?” These are the words of Jesus in Luke 6:46 . In giving the Great Commission, Jesus also said, “He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved….”  Mark 16:16 . The crucifiers of Jesus, after becoming believers in Him, asked, “Brethren, what shall we do ?” They were not told to “Just believe and accept Jesus,” or to just “feel” or “experience” anything. They were told to do something, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins…”  Acts 2:37-38 . Indeed, “faith without works is useless” and “dead,”  James 2:20,26 . Spiritual laziness doesn’t accomplish salvation. Likewise,   Some don’t want to “work” to remain saved. “Once saved, always saved” may be popular, but it is just not what the New Testament teaches. Please note that Peter warned against falling away, “You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your guard lest, being carried away by the error of unprincipled men, you fall from your own steadfastness,”  2Peter.3:17 . Hebrews 3:12 adds, “Take care, brethren, lest there should be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart, in falling away from the living God.” The very thing that many say cannot happen ( i.e. falling away/losing salvation/falling from grace ) is further stated to have occurred to some of the brethren in Galatia, “You have been severed from Christ….you have fallen from grace,”  Galatians 5:4 . Salvation, once attained by faith and obedience to the gospel, must be maintained with diligent and consistent effort. There is just no other way to accurately understand James 5:19-20 and Philippians 2:12-16 . But,   Some don’t want to “work” to grow and mature as Christians either. Our conversion to Christ by faith and baptism is not the end, it is a beginning from which we are supposed to grow, mature, and bear fruit to the Lord, 2Peter 3:18 ; John 15:1-2 . But this process of maturation takes a lot of diligent effort! While others can help to “water” the new plant ( cf. 1Corinthians 3:6-8a ), “each will receive his own reward according to his own labor ,”  v.8b ! To mix metaphors, Christians that only consume what they are bottle and spoon-fed usually become spiritually lazy and remain perpetually immature, cf. Hebrews 5:11 – 6:2 . To illustrate this point, if you do not already know what the passages that are referenced but not quoted in this article say, did you look them up “to see whether these things were so,”  Acts 17:11 ? All too often, spiritually lazy Christians attend a couple of one-hour services a month when it is convenient to them, rarely open a Bible while there, and never seriously study it otherwise, and yet claim to be “holding fast the word of life,”  Philippians 2:16 . Congregations provide multiple services to educate and edify each week that are poorly attended by their own members. Capable bible class teachers diligently prepare lessons that are left in the pews or classrooms unconsidered even by many who do attend them. Christian parents who say they want their children to become Christians rarely bring them to bible class, or study the Bible at home with them. Why? Spiritual laziness is surely the problem (or at least one of them).  What is the solution? “But, beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and things that accompany salvation, though we are speaking in this way. For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints. And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end, that you may not be sluggish , but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises,”  Hebrews 6:11-12 .","“Finding a stopping place” can be difficult- like when you sit down to a meal of your absolute favorite food. The “stopping place” is usually the bottom of an empty serving dish. Once you begin, there’s just not a good “stopping place!” Arbitrarily saying, “I’ll go this far, but stop here” is just not an option. The journey is only completed at the finish(ed) line! In much the same way, it ought to be so with our hunger for and application of bible authority. Once we begin to eat this “meat” ( Hebrews 5:12-14 ), we have to continue on to completion because there is just no “stopping point” short of it.  For instance, if we are willing to appeal to the authority of God’s word to understand what’s “right” or “wrong” about one particular issue, how do we then stop short of God’s authority for other matters? If God’s word is the proper authority to determine one issue of morality, why is it not also the right authority to decide all issues of morality? “For whoever keeps the whole law and stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all. For He who said ‘Do not commit adultery,’ also said, ‘Do not commit murder.’ Now if you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law,”  James 2:10-11 . We simply cannot afford to be “picky eaters” or “tasters” of God’s word to determine morality, we have to consume it all.  Let’s take another helping of this same dish. If God’s word is the proper authority to determine issues of morality, how can it possibly be anything less for issues of faith and doctrine (teaching)? When God’s word says there is “one Lord, one faith, and one baptism,” ( Ephesians 4:5 ), how can we say, “Having many differing faiths is a good thing because it allows everyone to find what’s right for them”? Or how can we say, “Baptism is important but not essential”? If having “one Lord” is essential, then so too are “one faith” and “one baptism.”   The same Bible that says murder and adultery are sinful, also says, “Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree, and there be no divisions among you, but you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment,”  1Corinthians 1:10 . It also says, “For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit,”  1Corinthians 12:13 . The only way we can be “one body” is to all eat and drink fully of the authority of God’s word.  We cannot appeal to our own thoughts and ideas for such is “self-made religion” ( Colossians 2:23 ), and making a “god” of our own “appetites” ( Philippians 3:19 ). Neither can we appeal to the thinking of modern culture for authority because 1Corinthians 1:21 is still true, “….the world through its wisdom did not come to know God….” But, we also cannot be true to God while appealing to uninspired the writings of men, whether new or ancient, as the basis of authority. Jesus condemns this in Matthew 15:6-9 , “And thus you invalidate the word of God for the sake of your tradition…. This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far away from Me. But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men.” There is just no stopping place with appealing to the authority of God’s word short of the bottom of the dish!  Here is one final “helping” of this authority dish. We cannot appeal to the authority of God’s word to determine issues of morality, faith, and doctrine without also allowing it to be the standard for our worship (collectively praising God). Please read your New Testament. It is the authoritative standard for Christ’s church. The Old Testament scriptures were the authoritative standard for Jews living prior to the death of Jesus (see Exodus 20:22 ; 2Corinthians 3:7-11 ; Hebrews 9:1-17 ), but the “gospel of the kingdom” of Jesus Christ is the sole authority for all men everywhere today, Luke 16:16 ; 2Thessalonians 2:14 . To worship and please Him, we must do so in the ways and with the means He provides in the authority of His Law. If it isn’t in the New Testament, it can’t be New Testament worship. If we are willing to appeal to the New Testament to determine issues of morality, faith, and doctrine, shouldn’t we also be willing to look to it for authority in worship?  The only “stopping place” to be found with regard to the authority of Jesus Christ is “all the way.” We simply cannot “pick and choose” the parts of His law we are willing accept- we must take and consume/apply it all!","“For what will a man be profited, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?”  Matthew 16:26 The Lord’s point, if I understand it correctly, is that there is no physical thing with which a man may buy back his forfeited soul. However, the context also makes it clear that the spiritual personal purchase price (in addition to the obvious sacrifice of Jesus, v.21 ) of one’s soul is self-denial, self-sacrifice, and true discipleship,  v.24 . However, let’s consider the Lord’s words from a slightly different perspective to see if it will help us come to a better understanding of these things.  While there is indeed no physical thing that a man  can  give in exchange to  purchase  his soul, there are several physical things that we  do  give in exchange to  forfeit  them ( cf. Hebrews 3:12ff ).   We exchange material needs and desires  for our souls. In Luke 14:16ff , Jesus told a parable where the offer of salvation is compared to “a big dinner” to which many had been invited. Notice that the first invitee exchanged the invitation (for the salvation of his soul) for the need he felt to look at land he had purchased, v.18 . How often the needs we feel for material things (possessions) are exchanged for our soul’s salvation! Jesus warned against this in Luke 12:15 , “Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not even when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions.” It is so easy to become wrapped up in the pursuit ofthe material things of life- things moths and rust destroy or that thieves steal ( Matthew 6:19-20 ), that we wind up exchanging the priceless value and eternal permanence of our souls for them.   We exchange business pursuits  for our souls. Back in the parable of Luke 14:16ff , the second invitee exchanged the invitation to his soul’s salvation for the opportunity to try out ten oxen he had recently purchased. So, his new tractor (important in an agrarian-based society) came before his soul. The Scriptures certainly teach that we should be industrious rather than lazy when it comes to providing for ourselves ( 1Thessalonians 4:11-12 ), our families ( 1Timothy 5:8 ), and even others ( Ephesians 4:28 ). But, the Bible also teaches that we have to keep our priorities straight, and always “seek first His kingdom, and His righteousness; and all these things will be added to you,”  Matthew 6:33 . “Work” is a physical necessity, but not to the exclusion of the spiritual needs of our souls! Don’t exchange “the bread which comes down out of heaven” to feed and save your soul for the “manna in the wilderness” of this world, cf. John 6:48-51 .   We exchange family connections  for our souls. Look one more time to Jesus’ parable in Luke 14:16ff . The final invitee to the feast excused himself from the benefits of attending because he had “married a wife,”  v.20 . Marriage is certainly honorable ( Hebrews 13:4 ), and our families certainly deserve our love, respect, and attention ( Ephesians 5:22-32 ; 6:4 ). But, even they cannot be allowed to take precedence in our lives over our God and our souls. Jesus plainly said that “He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me,”  Matthew 10:37 . And yet, how many people have exchanged their souls for the love of their families? How many precious souls are forfeited for “family ties”? Some forfeit their souls by following a spouse away from God and into sin. Some forfeit their souls by rejecting the truth they know for the family they love who are unwilling to abide in it. We are supposed to love, respect, and obey our families, but never more so than we do God, for in so doing we exchange our souls for family connections.  There is truly nothing that we can give in exchange for our souls in the sense of buying them back- Jesus alone is that redemptive purchase price, 1John 2:2; 4:10 . But there are many things, including the “passing pleasures of sin,”  Hebrews 11:25 , that we may and do give in exchange for our souls in the sense of forfeiting them. Your soul is the most precious thing you will ever possess. Jesus died to buy it back (redeem it) from sin. Don’t make that sacrifice worthless by exchanging anything for your soul!","God created living things to pretty much follow the same process of conception, gestation, birth, growth, maturity and reproduction, Genesis 1:24 . This pattern exists in the physical (particularly animal ) world, but unfortunately, rarely follows in the spiritual world of those claiming to be Christ’s church. Why is this? Could it be that they are not nearly as spiritually “alive” as they presume themselves to be? Perhaps so, but there are also other key reasons…   Some churches don’t grow because  they are made up of members who are not growing. Local congregations are made up of individual members. If most of the members are spiritually immature and not growing themselves, the congregation won’t grow for a simple reason: Reproductive growth is the product of spiritual maturation. If church members are not growing individually, they will not mature sufficiently to be spiritually reproductive. Spiritual reproduction, just like physical reproduction, is accomplished by the mature rather than the immature. Consider carefully this question: What is the real point of addingthe so-called “Christian Graces” of 2Peter 1:5-7 to your faith? Is it to make you an example of faith to be admired and respected? That may indeed happen, but such isn’t the stated reason. This growth surely assures the individual of continued faithfulness and eternal life, vv.10-11 ; but notice also that v.8 provides an additional purpose. “For if these qualities are yours and increasing , they render you neither useless nor unfruitful in the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.” Those who grow to maturity are “useful” because they  bear fruit  (which in keeping with the metaphor, contains even more reproductive seed )! And, let’s not forget or misconstrue John 15:1-8 on this particular point either.   Some churches don’t grow for the simple reason that they do not understand spiritual reproduction (growth) as a personal responsibility. When we comprehend that things are supposed to happen, we generally work toward that objective. Somewhere along the line, churches have forgotten, or have not been adequately taught, that it is the job of every Christian to reproduce themselves spiritually. It is God’s will for each saint, Colossians 1:25-27 ; 2Timothy 2:2 . This is how the early church grew so dramatically, Acts 8:1-4 . And, for far too long we have ignored the fact that Matthew 13:6,23 , the part about the good ground bearing fruit   of 100, 60,  and  30 fold  , is the point of the parable of the Sower! Spiritual reproduction is the job of every Christian. Churches comprised of members that don’t take this personal responsibility to heart die sooner or later- it is just a matter of time.   Some churches don’t grow due to the false notion that Christian “maturity” is determined by time rather reproduction. When a “mature Christian” is contemplated, most folks generally consider the length of time one has been a Christian as the main component. While spiritual maturity definitely has a time element to it ( cf. Hebrews 5:12 ; 1Timothy 3:6ff ), there are far too many Christians that are considered to be “mature” just because they have been Christians for a long time. Why isn’t spiritual reproduction considered? Plants, animals, and people are considered “mature” when they have grown sufficiently to reproduce. But somehow, and for no good reason, in the spiritual realm we never seem to think in these terms. Consider this: When we understand that our child is not growing at a normal rate, we start paying closer attention to the factors that produce growth to maturity like nutrition, exercise, and freedom from disease. Like the life cycles mentioned in the opening paragraph, these growth factors translate from the physical to the spiritual. The same types of factors that produce physical growth have their spiritual counterparts. So, if spiritual growth is not occurring, and because of it spiritual maturity is lacking, there is likely a deficiency in one or more of the factors that typically produce it: spiritual nutrition ( 1Peter 2:2 ) ; spiritual freedom from disease ( 1Peter 2:1 ) ; orspiritual exercise ( Hebrews 5:11 – 6:1 ). If a Christian isn’t growing sufficiently to mature and spiritually reproduce, something is wrong. To change this, we must stop thinking of spiritual maturity as only relating to time. “Growing up” spiritually also has to do with taking on the mature responsibilities of spiritual reproduction. This mindset must change for sustainable growth to occur.  While there are other factors that surely inhibit the growth of churches, it is hoped these can help us to think and act in ways that will ensure that the Cause of Christ not only survives, but thrives in and through growing local congregations.","Medals are awards that typically, and somewhat ironically, are made of soft metals- perhaps even cheap metals that are then plated over with a shiny metal or coating substance. This is ironic because the  mettle  (courage, bravery, determination, spirit, grit, resolve, guts) that is required to achieve a  medal  worth having is often not made of a truly representative  metal  .  Our society likes to be rewarded. We like trophies and medals. What we don’t like quite so much is the hard work, self-discipline, and dedication ( i.e. “mettle”) it takes to make the reward of a trophy or medal truly meaningful. Instead, we prefer to “pay our money” and get a “participation award”- which likely means that we paid more in dollars than we participated with devotion. Such “medals” (trophies/awards) are meaningless and should be made of unpolished lead.  Heaven is a spiritual place composed of spiritual things given as an eternal reward to the souls of spiritual people. As such, streets of gold and gates of pearl (see Revelation 21:18-21 ) are images meant to convey the splendors of this eternal reward, rather than literal representations. So, while the rewards of heaven are spiritual rather than physical, they are nonetheless real, and abiding in the presence of God for eternity is certainly the foremost among them, cf. John 14:1-3 ; Revelation 21:3-4 !  Paul spoke of the eternal reward of heaven as “the crown of righteousness” in 2Timothy 4:8 . This is the eternal crowning “medal” of heaven. There are some interesting contrasts between it and the “trophies” of this life:  · This “medal” is not a “pay your money and receive a participation trophy” kind of thing. Anyone who knows anything about the life of Paul knows this. This “medal” cannot be bought with money. “But whatever things were gain to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ,”  Philippians 3:7 . Simply “cutting a check for weekly/annual dues” won’t attain this honor, and neither will just “making the meetings.”  · This “medal” is actually worth far more than anything and everything sacrificed to attain it. Note again Paul’s words to the brethren on this point, “But more than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish in order that I may gain Christ,”  Philippians 3:8 .  · This “medal” is forged not with common “metals” of most, but with the “mettle” of the  knowledge  (of Jesus through His word),  spiritual regeneration  (through faith and rebirth by baptism),  suffering in fellowship  (as a Christian), and becoming  dead to sin and the things of this life  (as was Christ). Paul, again, highlights these “mettles” from his own life to the brethren in Philippi, “and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith, that I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,”  Philippians 3:9-10 .  · This “medal” is a “lifetime achievement award” whose benefits exceed the lifetime- “the resurrection from the dead,”  Philippians 3:11 . While the reward is eternal, its criteria is very much in the here and now.  All of this brings us back to the passage where we began, 2Timothy 4:8 and the “crown of righteousness.” The context says that this “medal” is given to those with the “mettle” of self-sacrifice, spiritual combat, perseverance, and mission accomplishment. Note the previous two verses in these regards, “For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith,”  2Timothy 4:6-7 . Will you be able to say the same at the end of your life? Will you receive the same “medal”? No, unless your “mettle” now is of the same kind as his.","But it usually makes us proficient- especially when practicing sin. The word “practice,” like many words, can be used as either a noun or a verb. As a noun, “practice” refers to an activity that is repeated until it becomes a habit. As a verb, it refers to the repeated rehearsal for the activity itself. Thus, sin can become our “practice” (noun) if we “practice” (verb) it diligently and consistently.  In Ephesians 2:1-2 , Paul included himself when he described some who “walked according to the course of this world” and “lived in the lusts of our minds, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind” to such an extent that they became “by nature children of wrath.” Becoming “by nature children of wrath” clearly does not refer to a genetic predisposition to sin, or some otherwise inherited sinful nature, because he emphasizes personal activity and indulgence as being the cause. So, there are sinful choices being made and practiced. What is being highlighted in the text is the principle that repeated indulgence of fleshly desires through sinful practices changes our habitude ( native or essential character ). We do not become sinners by being born that way, cf. Ezekiel 18:20ff ; we become sinners when we chose and “practice” the “works of the flesh” over the “fruit of the Spirit,”  Galatians 5:16-26 .  The more often that we make the choice to “practice” (verb) sin, the easier and faster it becomes our “practice” (noun). Just like any other activity, repetition leads to proficiency. Whether turning a double play on the baseball diamond, or baking a cake in the kitchen, repetition makes us better at performing the activity. It is no different with sin. By repetition, we learn what “works” best for us. We learn how to better hide the activity from those we know will disapprove. We learn how to better salve our consciences with excuses and justifications. And, we learn how to better mitigate any concerns of spiritual conscience, and minimize the physical consequences that may accompany the sinful practice(s). Thus we become proficient at sin by practice. And since we typically enjoy and indulge in the activities at which we become proficient, sin becomes easier, and therefore also becomes more and more the “practice” (noun) of our lives.  But thankfully, the same principles of practice apply in the other direction too. Just as we become more proficient at sin by practice, so too we can become more proficient at righteousness by practice! When we first decide by faith and repentance to live godly rather than sinful lives, the “practice” of righteousness is decidedly difficult. Like a baby learning to walk, there are many falls, bumps, and bruises along the way. 1John 1:8-10 makes it clear that sinful mistakes are just simply part of the process of learning to “walk by faith” ( 2Corinthians 5:7 ). But just like practicing sin, practicing righteousness leads to proficiency, and proficiency makes our walk of faith easier. There is no trick to it, and there are no short cuts. It just takes “practice”- diligent, repetitive, consistent, and concerted practice. The good news is that anyone can do it. If we genuinely want to please God by turning from the “unfruitful deeds of darkness” ( Ephesians 5:10-11 ), are willing to study and learn the playbook ( Ephesians 3:3-5 ) , and are willing to really dedicate ourselves through diligent “practice” ( Ephesians 4:11-16 ), then we can “walk no longer as the Gentiles walk” and “be renewed in the spirit of your mind” and “put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth” ( Ephesians 4:17, 23,24 ).   1John 3:4-10 , “Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. And you know that He appeared to take away sins; and in Him there is no sin. No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him. Little children, let no one deceive you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, that He might destroy the works of the devil. No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin because he is born of God. By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious; anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother.” Our “practices” (verb) determine our “practice” (noun).","Spiritual illiteracy and immaturity are certainly related, but not identical. While spiritual illiteracy is a cause of spiritual immaturity, it is not the only one. What else can one do to keep themselves spiritually immature?   Be too busy with work, recreation, relaxation, or other activities to attend worship and bible classes regularly . Obviously, it helps greatly with spiritual illiteracy and immaturity to occupy yourself with as many other discretionary activities as possible to avoid as many opportunities as possible to increase your knowledge of God and His word, Matthew 6:19-34 .   Be too busy with work, recreation, relaxation, or other activities to spend your discretionary time with brethren who may encourage you, or whom you may encourage, outside of worship or bible class . This way, you won’t be bothered with “other people’s problems,” and can devote all of your worry time toward your own selfish pity party, which helps dramatically with spiritual immaturity (because this is the way a spiritual two-year old acts), Hebrews 12:1-17 .   In the times you do attend worship services or bible study, insist on being spoon-fed all the spiritual nutrition you consume. Never make any effort to follow along in text, and never take any notes about things you can go back over later, or study more on your own. And, never make any preparations beforehand for bible class to be able to contribute to the discussion, or ask or answer any questions beyond the obvious ones, 2Timothy 2:15 and 2Peter 3:14-16 .   Be unwilling to consume anything but spiritual baby food (the sweet and easily-digestible kind) .  Refuse to eat (spiritually speaking) anything that doesn’t taste or feel familiar, you know, like everything you’ve always consumed previously. This will rule out trying anything new or more challenging. And don’t forget to insist on “sound-bite” solutions to every biblical passage, question, or application- even the difficult ones. This will also keep you in the “milk” rather than the “meat” of the word, Hebrews 5:11 – 6:2 .   Refuse to exercise your spiritual muscles so that they can grow and become strong. After all, if you were to become spiritually strong, it could mean that others might become dependent on you, or you might be called upon to do some “heavy lifting” in the kingdom. No, spiritually immature is the way to go to avoid responsibilities and keep everyone’s attention focused on you. So, by all means, refuse to grow in the ways 2Peter 1:5-7 describe, and for the reasons 2Peter 2:8-11 outline.   Keep yourself perpetually spiritually sick through constant exposure to, and indulgence in, sinful activities. Refuse the treatments the Scriptures (and those who teach them) provide, and instead spend most of your time with those already completely infected with sin. They will help to insure that the spiritual weakness of your immaturity develops into a full-blown case of sin so that spiritual death can ensue, Romans 6:12-16 and 2Timothy 2:21-26 .   Convince yourself that spiritual growth and development really isn’t necessary. After all, you’ve done what is necessary to become a “child of God”- isn’t that enough? Never mind the obvious comparisons between physical and spiritual organisms- that those who don’t grow out of infancy die. No, go right ahead and convince yourself that growth and development really aren’t necessary to spiritual survival. To help assure you of this fallacy, completely ignore 2Peter 3:17-18 and Ephesians 4:11-16 .  See? Remaining spiritually immature is actually pretty simple and easy. We just have to keep doing many of the same things we’re already doing! “Him we proclaim, warning and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that we may present everyone  mature  in Christ,”  Colossians 1:28 (ESV).","For the literate person, the ability to read and write is typically learned so gradually while younger, that it is largely taken for granted. The literates, therefore, can’t imagine what it’s like to not be able to read or write because they can’t really remember not being able to do so. But think about it for a moment, what if you couldn’t read or write? How dramatically different would your life be? Oh sure, you could still communicate verbally, but in our technology-dominate and information-driven world of today, how severely would your life be limited? Illiteracy, if uncorrected, is obviously a problem that greatly hinders one’s opportunities for success in life. But…    Spiritual   illiteracy , like the regular type, also greatly hinders one’s opportunities for success in life. However, spiritual illiteracy, if uncorrected, is a problem that also leads to everlasting torment. Please consider two passages in this regard. Ephesians 3:3-5 , “that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. And by referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ…”.  2Thessalonians 1:7-9 , “…when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire, dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. And these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power.” From these verses, two things become abundantly clear relative to our topic: 1) Spiritual enlightenment is dependent upon our willingness to understand the gospel of Jesus Christ by reading it for ourselves: and, 2) Those unwilling to come to the knowledge of God, and obedience to His gospel, will be eternally lost.  So, if it is your intent to forfeit the eternal destiny of heaven by remaining spiritually illiterate, here are a few tips to help accomplish that goal:   Don’t learn the order of the books of the Bible. This way, you’ll have difficulty looking up passages for yourself to see whether the things are so that someone else told you about the text, Acts 17:11 . Thus, your faith will always be dependent upon someone else’s understanding of, and accuracy with, the Scriptures.   Don’t learn the basic division between the Testaments. This way, you’ll never really understand that the “Old” Testament, while inspired and important, was given to those of the nation of Israel living before the death of Christ, or that the “New” Testament became God’s law for everyone after that point, Hebrews 8:13 ; 9:1-17 . Thus, you’ll never be able to “handle accurately the word of truth,”  2Timothy 2:15 .   Tell yourself that the Bible is too big and confusing for you to understand. This way, you’ll feel much better about leaving any real understanding and application of it to “the experts.” Question: How many “theologians” did Jesus select to “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature,”  Mark 16:15 ? But, if you tell yourself that the Bible is too big and confusing for you to understand, one thing is certain: you will never try to do so. And thus, you will remain spiritually illiterate regardless of the number of experts consulted.   Tell yourself that no one really understands the Bible anyway. This way, at least you’ll feel better now about refusing to read and study a book that God inspired and provided to lead you through life to heaven, 2Timothy 3:16-17 ; Romans 10:17 . And, don’t bother yourself with the fact that saying “no one really understands the Bible anyway” indicts God as being unable to provide understandable instructions to man whom He created, and wants to save.   Convince yourself that you don’t really have time to study and learn the Bible. This way, all the time spent on social media, watching television, recreation, relaxing, and doing all the other more desirable things won’t seem like such a waste by comparison. None of those things will teach you how to live in such a way as to be welcomed into heaven after death, but at least you’ll have “fun” while you’re here, Luke 16:19-31 !   Refuse to attend the readily available and free multiple classes that are offered at your local church each week that are specifically designed and delivered to help you understand God’s Word. This way, you can continue to do a lot with that extra two hours each week besides reading and studying the Word of God together with those who want to learn, understand, and live it, Acts 20:32 . After all, isn’t spiritual ignorance “bliss” also?","The front of our lot has about a ten-foot high bank that runs the length of the street frontage. While the bank is sloped enough to mow lengthwise, it is fairly steep. At the bottom of the slope there is a curb. Since there is a considerable grade that runs upward from the curb to the level ground above, runoff is a problem. But the main issue is that the grass (and weeds) and dirt are always spilling over the curb and clogging up the drainage gutter. So, at several times a year, I have to cut/edge and shovel off the excess dirt, and the grass that seemingly grows faster there than anywhere else. I hate this task. It’s hot, dirty, and hard work; and that dreaded curb seems to be a mile long.  To make the job at least a little easier, several years ago I bought a shovel specifically to use for this task. It’s a fairly large square shovel with a long heavy-duty handle. Since the sides of the shovel were sloped outward, it didn’t work very well. It kept hanging up on and digging into the bank as I slid it down the length of the curb to clean off the cut grass and dirt. So, I took the shovel out to the shop and slightly heated one side of it with a torch. Then I laid it on the anvil, and reshaped the edge with a hammer until if formed a 90-degree angle. Feeling pleased with that improvement, I opted for another one. I also heated the tang (hollow part of the shovel blade where the handle attaches) and carefully bent it to one side. This modification would allow the shovel to be more comfortably used from the gutter, instead of having to keep one foot up on the curb or bank. With these improvements, the shovel worked well for several years. But this year, a new problem arose.  While cleaning that dreaded and seemingly mile-long curb yet again, my modified shovel kept getting tired, and I would have to let it rest for several minutes at a time to keep it from overheating! I guess it’s gotten old, weak, and just doesn’t work very well anymore. Maybe it’s time to replace it- “I think I need a new shovel.”  Do we use this same kind of obviously flawed logic with regard to the spiritual “tools” God has given us? Reasoning that is so lacking in self-awareness as to be unwilling to consider that the real culprit might not be the “tool” but the “operator?” While it is true that my curb shovel has, over the years of use, become kind of dull and dented in a few places, it’s nothing that a little care and maintenance wouldn’t solve. So, please consider that…  A  new bible   , even an electronic one, will “work” no better than the old one unless the “operator” uses it enough to become proficient with it. 2Timothy 2:15 , “Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, handling accurately the word of truth.”   A  new church  will likely soon be discovered to have many of the same “problems” as the old one unless the “goer” becomes actively invested and involved enough to help solve them. Philippians 2:12-13,16 , “So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure… holding fast the word of life...”   A  new bible class program  probably won’t be any “better” than the old one unless it has “prepared” teachers and “regular” students who desire to learn. 2Timothy 3:14-15 , “You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them; and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.”   Tools do sometimes need modification and maintenance to function properly, or even better. But, no “tool” works without a dedicated, prepared, and proficient “operator.” This surely includes the  spiritual  tools God has given us- like the Bible, local congregations, and bible classes. Sometimes it is the “operator” instead of the “tool” that is dull, dented, and thus, doesn’t work well. The “shovel” may indeed need sharpening, but the “operator” still has to be willing and able to “work” for things to get done right and well.","We all likely play “mind games” from time to time. Some obviously do so more than others. At times, we use these mental tactics on other people, perhaps to gain an edge over or influence them in some way. However, most of our mind gaming efforts are expended on ourselves, and for the same reasons. We play these games on or with ourselves in an effort to manipulate or influence our own thinking to do or not do something that our heart wants, or to excuse or justify what we’ve already done. What do I mean? See if these examples sound familiar…  The “Is It Really Wrong?” Game. We actually already know the answer to this question; we just don’t want to accept the answer. So, we play this mind game and pose the question anyway hoping for some way to excuse or justify the activity because it is what we want to do. The subtle serpent Satan got Eve to play this game in Genesis 3:4-6 .  The “It Isn’t A Big Deal” Game. We usually play this game after playing “Is It Really Wrong?” game and realizing that the answer is still “yes.” So, rather than just admitting defeat and accepting that we shouldn’t do what we want to do, we switch to this game. Notice that this game admits the activity is wrong (and therefore shouldn’t be done), but seeks to justify the activity anyway by claiming that this particular “wrong” activity is somehow “less wrong” than other “wrong activities.” Romans 6:23 doesn’t use this (or allow) this method of classifying sin.  The “It Won’t Hurt Anything Just This One Time ” Game. This game also is usually played after the previous two have been played and lost. The desired activity is still desired despite the previous defeats, so we move on to this game. Notice the progression: the activity is admitted to not only be “wrong,” but also to have harmful consequences; but, the object of this game is to justify the wrong activity anyway by claiming that its harmful consequences only ensue after repeated offenses. Uzzah probably would not agree with that conclusion, 2Samuel 6:6-7 (his life was taken because of a single offense).  The “It’s Not Hurting Anyone Else” Game. There is progression, or more precisely, digression, again. Now we’re admitting that the desired activity is wrong, and that it has harmful consequences, but are still clinging to the desired activity anyway by claiming that it is only harmful to me, and therefore does not affect anyone else. While there may be some “private” sins that don’t affect anyone else, such is not really the point. The “private” rather than “public” consequences of a sinful activity do not make it any less sinful or consequential for the player personally. There is no real “win” when playing this game, Romans 6:16 .  The “It’s Not Really Who I Am” Game. This particular game claims that a “win,” which means going ahead and doing/justifying the desired activity despite admitting that it is wrong, contradicts the outcome. In other words, it claims that committing sin doesn’t make one a sinner. Ezekiel 18:26 surely seems to say otherwise.  The “I Can Quit Anytime I Want ” Game. Note that playing this game concedes defeat in all the previous ones. It admits the desired activity is wrong, has harmful personal consequences, and that it makes the participant a sinner destined for destruction. But, playing it bolsters the notion that desire is all that is necessary to stopping a sinful activity and altering our future course. Millions of addicts would strongly disagree, and so does the Bible, Matthew 27:3-5 .  The “I’ll Straighten Up Later” Game (aka, the “Wild Oats Game ”). This one is very much akin to the previous game. It is based on the premise that each person has some allowed quota of sin before “growing up.” Galatians 6:7-8 proves this premise to be completely false.  The “I’ve Already Gone This Far” Game. The idea behind this game seems to be that “If one sin can condemn me, I might as well go ahead and get my monies’ worth while I’m at it.” There are many problems here, but perhaps the main one is that the more “wrong” turns we make, the harder it is to get back to the “right” road. By playing this game, we surrender to defeat. What if Paul had played this one, cf. 1Timothy 2:15-16 ?  The “It’s Too Late For Me Anyway” Game. This is the ultimate surrender mind game we play with ourselves. It admits total defeat and is unwilling to even continue the struggle against sin. But again, IT’S BASED ON A FALSE PREMISE! If a denier of the deity of Jesus and persecutor of the church can repent and become a preacher of righteousness, so can you, 1Corinthians 15:9-10 .  Don’t play mind games with yourself- defeat is the only outcome, and your soul is at stake. Read the Word, study the Word, and understand and live the Word (“yes” you can)!","The word of God says, “Hate evil, you who love the Lord…” in Psalm 97:10 ; and, “Hate evil, love good…” in Amos 5:15 . This is certainly not going to be a hate-fomenting article; the world has far too much of that already. And, to point out what should be obvious, God (not man!) gets to determine what is “evil” and what is “good,” and does so through the revelation of His Word to us in the Bible, Galatians 5:19-25 . But aside from these things, here’s the question we should be asking, “Is there a difference between  hating what is evil  and  loving what is good/right   ?” Can one be done without the other? The answer is, “Yes,” and “Yes.” One can “hate evil,” and even be repulsed by it, without really “loving right.”  In the parable of “The Good Samaritan,” Luke 10:25-37 , Jesus uses the story of an unfortunate man, two “religious” men, and a perceived enemy to teach an important lesson of mercy and compassion. In the story, the unfortunate man , while traveling, fell prey to robbers who beat, stripped, and left him half-dead. Both a priest and the Levite separately happened upon the unfortunate man, and saw his pitiful and obviously helpless condition, but “passed by on the other side” regardless. These piously religious and seriously devout men undoubtedly “hated evil”- possibly so much so that they didn’t even want to be close to the “results” of it. Perhaps they were concerned with “getting involved,” or even with becoming “unclean” through contact with someone they might have thought to be dead, cf. Numbers 19:11-13 . But whatever their motivations, and though “hating evil,” they certainly did not “love good” enough to even check on, let alone help, the unfortunate man. They just “passed by on the other side.”   The Samaritans were a race derived from people imported by the Assyrians to settle the land from which they had captured, killed, or deported the northern ten tribes of Israel (722 B.C.). These “imports” intermarried with the remaining Jews who were deemed not worth the effort to kill or deport to Assyria. So, the Jews of Jesus’ day hated the Samaritans as “half-breeds” and “interlopers,” cf. John 4:9 ; which is probably why He chose a Samaritan for the “good guy” in this story.  In the parable, this perceived enemy of the Jews surely “hated evil,” and was repulsed by it, as were the priest and the Levite. But, his hatred did not end with simple disdain for evil, and avoidance of its results. Because he also  “loved good,” he “felt compassion, and came to him, and bandaged up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them; and he put him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him,”  Luke 10:33-34 . Additionally, the next day, he paid the innkeeper to care for the man further, and promised to reimburse any additional expenditures incurred when he returned, v.35 .  The priest’s and Levite’s neighbors would certainly have vouched for them as “haters of evil.” But, the man who fell among the robbers could vouch for the Samaritan that he was also a “lover of good.” Please contemplate these things, and further consider the following:  · We shouldn’t minimize being properly repulsed by and fleeing from true evil, for the Scriptures teach the necessity of this, 2Corinthians 6:14-18 ; but,  · Such is very different from turning a “blind eye” toward the innocent results of evil, or avoiding the responsibility of human compassion and care, 1John 3:17-18 ; 4:20 .  · Being even properly and rightly repulsed by and “hating evil” is not the same thing as “loving good.” No one will be saved on the Day of Judgment solely because of what they avoided, or didn’t do, Matthew 25:31-46 .  “Loving good” requires a corresponding “hate for evil,” and harm it produces, to the extent that it causes us to do something to mitigate or eliminate those effects with compassion, kindness, and the truth of the gospel, Ephesians 5:11-17 .","Most Christians recognize that God entrusts parents with the spiritual education of their children. This was true under the Old Law ( Deuteronomy 6:6,7 ), and is equally true under the Law of Christ ( Ephesians 6:4 ). From the passage in Ephesians, we recognize that the burden of this responsibility falls squarely on the shoulders of fathers as the spiritual leaders in the home. At the same time, we understand that mothers have the obligation to aid their husbands in the spiritual development of the children ( Genesis 2:18 ).  Certainly, because of our deep respect for God and His will, we should be diligently devoted to the cause of teaching our children about Him. Furthermore, because we fear standing in judgment with the shame of having neglected our responsibility, we are compelled to be fervent in our efforts ( Matthew 25:14-30 ).  We also recognize another factor that should lead us to be serious in this regard. Peter says we must be sober and vigilant because of the destructive efforts of our adversary ( 1Peter 5:8 ). We need to recognize the truth of this statement, and not be ignorant of his schemes ( 2Corinthians 2:11 ). Satan knows the best way to destroy a community, state, or nation as a whole, is to begin in the home by striking at the very core of what makes any economy successful. Thus, parents must be careful not to allow him a foothold to deceive them into thinking other things are more important. They must ever be reminded of the importance of making spiritual matters a priority in their own lives ( Matthew 6:33 ), and imparting those truths to their children.  With that said, it is crucial for parents show devotion in teaching their children. Furthermore, it is imperative that they recognize where they are most effective in this endeavor. Too many parents rely on bible classes to meet the pressing needs of their children. While it is true bible classes are very beneficial toward this end, it must be recognized that these, at best, are simply a supplement to the teaching that takes place in the home. In other words, bible classes, as good as they are, will never be as beneficial to our children's spiritual education as will our efforts as parents to daily communicate to them the importance of serving God ( Deuteronomy 6:6,7 ; Psalm 34:11 ).  No doubt, there are parents today who take this responsibility seriously, and make spiritual education a priority. I have seen firsthand the efforts made by godly parents to train their children in the ways of God, and also the result of these efforts as their children grow to develop their own faith. To these parents, Christianity is not just a show, or something to be taken lightly. It is a lifestyle, and an obligation born out of their love and respect for God, and for the Savior who loved them enough to die for them.  Is this the attitude we have? Are we making spiritual education in the home a priority, or do we neglect this responsibility? Are we so focused on helping our children excel in secular activities that spiritual training gets swept aside? Are we so self-absorbed that we make no time to show love for our children in this regard?  Let me assure you, those devoted to the Lord place the emphasis where it needs to be. They recognize the fact that they will have these blessings in their trust for only a few short years. As a result, they make the most of the opportunity God gives them.  How devoted are we to supplying our children with the spiritual education God expects us to give them? -Clay Thornton","And that’s the way she says it- with a drawn out and heavy emphasis on  “y our .”  She says it when I do something out of character, especially if it’s something she thinks is good, gracious, or extra nice, like eating vegetables, letting her have the TV remote, or watching some cooking or home-decorating show with her, instead of retreating to the bedroom to see the ballgame. Then she pretends not to recognize me and asks, “What’s  y our   name?” It’s OK, I deserve it- and then some. But there is another side to this brief saga....  When I do something that nearly 29 years of marriage have taught her to expect from me, she says, “I   know   your name!” This is usually pretty much the inverse of the previous things mentioned: the not-so-good, not-very-gracious, or the certainly- not-extra-nice things, like burping loudly after eating way too much of a meal consisting entirely of meat smothered with gravy, hogging the remote, or refusing to attend a play or some other “artsy” event with her. Then she portends to  know  my name because I am being consistent to the character my previous actions have led her to expect from me.  Both sides of these exchanges are all in good fun, and we typically get a good laugh from them. She’s a great lady who tries hard to take care of me in spite of my bad habits and poor tendencies, and I love her dearly for it. But, there is a spiritual point to these things….  It’s generally assumed that last names evolved to distinguish people with the same first names. These last names were often derived from a person’s occupation. Thus, John the blacksmith became John Smith. As Christians, we take on the name of Christ- our avocation (one’s passionate endeavor )as opposed to our vocation (one’s job), when we become spiritually united with Him through faith and baptism, Galatians 3:26-27 ; Ephesians 5:22-33 . So, our conduct and character ought to be consistent with our name, right?  I can’t help but wonder if the Father above ever looks down at me and says, “What’s  y our   name?” because my actions are surprisingly, and in a good way, out of character? This could only occur if I had previously consistently conducted myself in a way that was inconsistent with the name “Christian” that I professed to wear. Certainly, God knows anything and everything He chooses to know ( cf. Genesis 11:5; 18:21; 22:12 ), so I’m certainly not doubting or disputing His omniscience. I’m just supposing “what if” to make a point. God, like my wife, could easily ask me, “What’s  y our   name?” when I’m doing what is good if such is actually out of character for me!  Conversely, but to the same point, God could also say, “I   know   your name!” if I continue to act as I always have, despite the fact that I know better, and that such activity is contrary to the name “Christian” I profess to wear. This is also known as rebellion, or “sinning willfully,” and has its own particular set of consequences, cf. Hebrew 10:26-31 .  Now, what would God say about  y our   name in light of the consistency of your character and conduct? “Little children, let no one deceive you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous; just as He is righteous; the one who practices sin is of the devil….By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious; any one who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother,”  1John 3:7,8,10 . “What’s  y our   name?” or “I   know   your name!”- which is it for you?","Let’s start with some hopefully not-too-boring-but-accurate definitions of terms. “Denominational” is a word used to describe a church which is bound by association to an outside organizational headquarters. How much control is exercised over local congregations by the parent headquarters varies from one denomination to another. “Inter-Denominational” is exactly what the word implies- a church comprised of members from various denominations. Such congregations often disavow controlling outside influences from denominational headquarters, but typically retain some standards, practices, and teaching of them internally. However, inter-denominational groups usually think of, and refer to themselves as “non-denominational,” despite the continued acceptance of their concepts and doctrines. By contrast, truly “non-denominational” congregations shun all denominational control, practices, organizations, and teaching. Each congregation is instead completely autonomous ( self-governed ), and therefore, what is taught and practiced is determined within the local congregation itself. Furthermore, in this “non-denominational” arrangement, there is no structure above or beyond the local church; there are no earthly “headquarters” or outside “organizational associations.” Now, the big question: Which of these arrangements is correct? The question is easily answered by a simple search of the New Testament to see which one God ordained. Let’s see what the Book says....   Ephesians 4:4 , “There is one body….” Since Ephesians 1:22-23 identifies “the body” as “the church,” having multiple denominations all teaching and practicing different things is not the biblical plan or arrangement. While some seek to use 1Corinthians 12:12ff to authorize the existence of many divergent denominations because the passage speaks of differing “parts of the body,” a careful reading of the context reveals that Paul is actually saying that the  local congregation  is “the body” in this case, and its distinct “parts” ( i.e. the foot, eye, hand, etc. ) are the  individual members  , see vv.12-27 . Simply put, Christ built “one” church, and expects everyone to be “one” within it. “I do not ask in behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through their word; that they all may be one…”   John 17:20-21 . Multiple “denominations” (which implies division ) teaching and practicing different things, but all claiming to follow the Bible, was never the intention of Jesus. Instead, Christians were exhorted “by the name of Jesus Christ, that you all agree , and there be no divisions among you, but you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment,”  1Corinthians 1:10 .  Additionally, the “denominational” arrangement has another significant problem. The New Testament simply does not authorize any organization larger than the local congregation. Local congregations are to be led by overseers, bishops, elders, or pastors- which all refer to the same office according to Acts 20:17,28 (the terms are used interchangeably). These overseers must meet the qualifications for the office as given in 1Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:7-9 . Furthermore, their oversight is clearly limited to the local congregation in which they have become qualified, 1Peter 5:2 ( “shepherd the flock of God among you ” ). There is just no provision in the New Testament for a separate board of directors, council, or denominational headquarters. Each congregation is to be led by a plurality of elders (more than one, according to Acts 14:23 ) who take the Bible as their only creed, and teach and practice what it dictates.  What about the “inter-denominational” arrangements? The problem with “inter-denominational” is that it either: 1) accepts denominational biases and practices despite differences, instead of insisting on unity through “book, chapter, and verse” authority; or, 2) forces the compromise of convictions for the sake of ecumenism (acceptingdivergent beliefs and practices despite contrary personal conviction). Neither of these consequences agree with scripture. “If there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion, make my joy complete by being of the same mind,  maintaining the  same love , united in spirit, intent on one purpose,”   Philippian 2:1-2 .  What have we learned? The New Testament teaches that God’s ordained arrangement of the church, and its subsequent congregational government, requires: 1) local autonomous groups; 2) led by multiple overseers who meet the specified qualifications; 3) and lead the congregation according the Bible only; 4) without the additional control of external boards or associations. Anything else (or more!) just can’t be found in the New Testament, and thus is an arrangement of man rather than God.","When Jesus entered the temple in Jerusalem and began to drive out the merchants and money-changers, He said, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer;’ but you are making it a robber’s den,”  Matthew 21:13 . What would the Savior say today upon walking into modern structures claiming to be houses of God? Would He consider them houses of prayer , or something else? Would He likewise call them “robber’s dens” because they house those using “religion” as a place of hiding while taking others’ money? Or would He just call them a:     “House of    Players, ” due to their emphasis on athletic teams and sports-related activities? In 1Corinthians 9:24-27, Paul used athletics as an example to teach the importance of: obeying the rules,  v.24 ; self-control,  v.25 ; and avoiding disqualification,  vv.26-27 ; but he did so to teach spiritual lessons, not to authorize church sporting events or athletic programs.    “House of    Payers, ” since those in charge always seem to be asking for more money? There are two issues here requiring attention: 1) the authorized collection of funds; and, 2) the authorized expenditure of funds. 1Corinthians 16:1-2 authorizes only free-will collections on “the first day of every week”- not “tithing,” or asking for money every time there is an assembly. Secondly, churches typically need more and more money because they have more and more programs to support, which are usually not authorized by the N.T. in the first place. Obviously, there are expenditures associated with securing a place to meet for worship and study, but beyond this, what else does the N.T. authorize? The N.T. church used collected funds to support needy saints locally and elsewhere,  Acts 4:32-35 ; Romans 15:25-27 ; and to financially support those preaching and teaching the gospel locally or elsewhere,  1Corinthians 9:12-13 . That’s it- period. If churches today would collect and spend money the way the N.T. authorizes, perhaps less would be needed.    “House of    Programmers, ” as there is a seemingly endless supply of new ones? (This house is often a duplex with the House of Pay! ) 1Timothy 3:15 records, “I write so that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of truth.” Paul was giving Timothy inspired instructions on how churches could and should be the purveyorsof God’s word. Read Timothy- both letters to him, and the rest of the N.T. to see if the “programs” which seem oh so “necessary” to us, were a part of God’s plan for the church. If they are not found in God’s word, they’re not only unnecessary; they are probably also a violation of God’s will.    “House of    Pantomimes, ” because the people inside are pretending to be something they’re not? Paul, again, stated it pretty clearly, “But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith,”  1Timothy 1:5 . Churches filled with people honestly endeavoring to possess and further develop these qualities aren’t “playing church,” nor are they hypocritically attempting to “keep up appearances” of piety while living sinful lives, cf. 2Timothy 3:1-7 . They are, instead, the very opposite of such- true Christians sincerely striving to please God above all else.    “House of    Pluralism, ” because the notion that there is one  body, Spirit, hope, Lord, faith, baptism, and one God ( Ephesians 4:4-6 ) has become foreign to them? “Pluralism” exists when people are together in some association, but each maintains his own traditions, beliefs, and interests; such is clearly not the Lord’s way for “His” house, cf. Philippians 2:1-2 . And yet, hungry for memberships at all costs, many churches have cast aside the truth of God’s word for what will be acceptable to or popular with the masses. Thus, they stand for nothing and bow to everything.  Why not clean house, and return God’s house to being one of  prayer   , rather than one of  players, payers, programmers, pantomimes,  and  pluralism?  If we don’t, He will, Matthew 15:13 .","The experience of “getting the cart before the horse” has taught us that there is often a proper if not essential order to things that must be observed to fully benefit from them. This is true with regard to how the constituent elements of our physical being work in concert to determine our conduct. Think about the following carefully, please….  Do your  feelings  dictate your actions, and then your thoughts have to try to rationalize what has already been done?  Do your  actions  simply react to stimuli without really thinking or feeling anything- at least until afterwards? Or,  Do your  thoughts  determine your actions, and your feelings then emanate from them?  Obviously, we all function in all of these various ways from time to time. There are occasions when we react emotionally without really thinking through the consequences. There are other times when we simply act impulsively without any real emotional or intellectual incentive. But hopefully, there are also times when we act only after deliberate consideration. While we may not be able to completely divorce our thought processes from emotional influences- nor should we necessarily, it is important that our heads come first in the “chain of command” to determine our actions rather than our hearts. Why is this true?  Hearts, and the emotions that come from them, are fickle things. They often vacillate widely from one extreme to the other, usually from temporary and external influences. “Following ones’ heart” thus often becomes a very winding road with many switchbacks and complete course changes. To illustrate this point, think of small children. One moment they’re crying almost uncontrollably, and the next they’re giggling equally uncontrollably. Why? They are immature, and are thus easily influenced by temporary and external motivations. This is exactly how they should function since they are, after all, children. But as we mature, the intellect is supposed to gradually take over the controlling influence of our activities from our emotions. Cognitive and reasoning skills should begin to override purely emotional decisions, which are really reactions rather than decisions anyway. This process is called “maturation,” or more simply, “growing up.”  These things have specific application value in our spiritual growth and development. Consider Jesus’ words of Matthew 5:39 , “But I say to you, do not resist him who is evil; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.” First, please understand that a “slap” is an insult, not an attack on personal safety. But more importantly, who is able to fulfill Jesus command? Is it the person whose emotions dictate their reaction to a personal affront, or the one whose deliberate thought considers the ultimate good of all concerned before reacting? The first is a purely emotional reaction born of spiritual immaturity that will likely return “evil for evil,”  see v.38 ; while the latter is a thoughtful reaction born of spiritual maturity which provides testimony to the offender and glory to God, see vv.40-48 .  Look at another application from James 1:19 , “This you know, my beloved brethren. But let every one be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.” If we are spiritually immature, we might be inclined to react to this verse with, “I can’t do that- it’s just not who I am; I just say what’s in my heart, and if others don’t like it, that’s just tough.” But again, let’s think this verse through a bit before discounting it as an impossible goal. First, God says, “be quick to hear.” This involves a readiness to not only listen, but to hear and consider. Such implies thoughtful consideration of what is heard, rather than an immediate emotional reaction to it. Second, God says to be, “slow to speak.” This hesitancy to instantaneously respond to what has been heard gives the brain, which typically functions a little slower and more cautiously than the heart, time to process and digest what has been said so that an intelligent (rather than emotional) and productive response can be given. And third, God says to be, “slow to anger.” While anger might indeed be the righteous response to what has been heard, such should only come slowly after careful deliberation has been given to not only what was actually said, but also to what actually should be said in response. Thus, the emotion should follow the thought and the action, rather than precede them.  If we can learn to put our emotions after thoughtful consideration and appropriate action, we will be a lot more pleasing and productive in the kingdom because we will have spiritually “grown up.” We’ll feel better too because the right “horse” (of our intellect) will be pulling the cart of our activities instead of them being pushed by the “mule” of our emotions!","“If you tie two cats’ tails together, and drop them over opposite sides of the clothesline, you may have  unison  , but you surely won’t have  unity!   ” Although I’ve never seen or done this, visualizing the chaos and caterwauling that would result provides insight to “unison” and “unity.” Unfortunately, “unison” is often what we have instead of “unity” in our churches. Despite having a “tie” that binds us together, true “unity” often does not really exist. So, we act and treat one another about the same as we imagine our illustrative cats would, and the fur flies- and unbelievers have a more difficult time understanding why they should become Christians, cf. John 17:21 .  These things beg two important questions: 1) How do we become united; and, 2) how do we stay united? Let’s take them one at a time.  How do believers  become  united with one another in Christ? Let’s see what the Bible says about the first “church” fellowship in Acts 2 . How did they become “united”? They had a:    -Common Birth/Salvation  . “So then, those who had received his word were baptized; and there were added that day about three thousand souls,”  v.41 . How could any group of individuals hope to have true unity if there was not a common entrance into the relationship they claim to share? They were all previously “united” under the bondage of sin, v.36 ; and they were all told to do same thing in order to receive the forgiveness of their sins, “Repent, and let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins…”  v.38 . So, they shared a common birth into Christ by repentance and baptism (see also 1Corinthians 12:13 ).    -Common Devotion/Worship   . “And they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, and to the breaking of bread and to prayer,”  v.42 . For these new Christians to be “continually devoting themselves” to the “apostles’ teaching,” they had to come together in an assembly. Thus, the devotions mentioned in this verse seem to indicate the acts of worship through which they were united- apostles’ teaching (hearing the Word) , fellowship (it means joint participation ) , breaking bread (communion) , and prayer (public/congregational). Simply put: They not only shared a common birth by belief, repentance, and baptism, they shared a common devotion of worship based on the instructions of the apostles. They were all born the same way, and they all worshipped the same way- as God said.    -Common Emotion/Feelings   .“And everyone kept feeling a sense of awe…”  v.43 . Proper and mutual emotion in religion is not derived from contrived worship performances; it is achieved by being family (of the same birth ), and being joined together in mutual devotion (of worship) to God. Then, because we are family, and worship together the same Father in the same way, our hearts are blended together in common emotion for Him and one another. This kind of emotion will result from doing the right things in the right ways together.     -Common Effort/Work   .“And all those who had believed were together….”  vv.44-47 . Their common birth, worship, and emotion also led to a fellowship of selfless service. Each stopped being so caught up with self, and began working together for God’s purposes and helping each other. As a result, they worked together, ate together, studied together, and praised together. Basically, they became united!  How do believers  stay  united in fellowship with one another in Christ? Note what Paul wrote to the brethren at Philippi on the subject, “by being of the same mind , maintaining the same love , united in spirit , intent on one purpose ,”  Philippians 2:2 . To stay “united” with other believers in fellowship, our minds, hearts, and souls must come together in the  single    intent  ofpleasing God, v.13 . How is such accomplished? Look again to the text: 1) “do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit,”  v.3a ; 2) “but with humility of mind let each of you regard one another as more important than himself,”  v.3b ; 3) “do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others,”  v.4 ; and, 4) take on the attitude and activity of Christ Jesus, vv.5-8 . While other things, such as having the same “platform” of unity are involved (see Ephesians 4:4-6 ), the key to achieving and maintaining unity is simple: Read the Bible, and do what it says, when it says, how it says. To become truly united, we must put away our own egos, ideas, and desires and come together on a “thus sayeth the Lord!”","There is a huge difference between being patient and being dead , obviously. This is true physically and spiritually- which is equally apparent. In our last article, the importance of “patient faith,” and trusting God and His ways, was emphasized through the story of Abraham and Sarah. Eventually, as we learned, they stopped trying “help” God (through adoption and surrogacy ) fulfill His promise to give them a son. Instead, Abraham and Sarah finally learned to patiently trust and obey God. He then, in turn, blessed them with Isaac, the son He had promised. But…  Being “patiently faithful” and trusting in God did not mean that Abraham and Sarah just sat down and waited for God to fulfill His promise of “giving” them a child! While there is no need to be crass or crude, Romans 4:18-21 makes it clear that although Abraham’s body was “as good as dead,” his faith was very much alive and well. “In hope against hope he believed, in order that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, ‘So shall your descendants be.’ And without becoming weak in faith, he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb; yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief, but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully assured that what He had promised, He was able to perform.” Simply put, Isaac was not born by immaculate conception. However, Isaac’s conception is not really the point.  The point is that while Abraham and Sarah’s faith became “patiently obedient,” such does not mean that they did nothing and just waited for God to act in their behalf. They were, instead, faithfully obedient to God’s promise and each other in the matter. All of which also illustrates the principle so plainly taught in James 2:17 , “Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.” If their faith had not led them to be active participants, God would have never blessed their efforts with the child, Isaac. Surely we can see the implications of these things in regard to the “blessing” of salvation. Is salvation a “gift” from God? Absolutely, “For by grace have you been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast,”  Ephesians 2:8-9 . But please also consider this question: Was Isaac a “gift” from God? Again, the answer is “absolutely,” cf. Genesis 15:2,4 and Romans 4:17 . However, we must acknowledge that the “gift” of Isaac by God did not preclude Abraham’s active participation in order to receive it. If we can see this with Abraham’s faith in receiving God’s gift of Isaac, why can’t we see it in regard to our faith requiring active participation in order to receive God’s gift of salvation? Especially when this is one of the points being made in Romans 4 ?  However, there is another application of these things that needs to be made. As we now understand that God’s grace combines with our active and obedient faith to provide salvation, we must also comprehend that just arriving at the point of salvation from sin is not the end of the matter. After becoming saved by grace and faith, we do not then just patiently await Christ’s return while doing nothing. Surely this “dead faith” of the sort described in James 2:14-26 , and does not result in eternal salvation, vv.24,26 . In fact, James uses Abraham to illustrate this point in v.23 , “and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, ‘Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,’ and he was called the friend of God.” Having now understood that Abraham’s faith was rewarded with the gift of Isaac only when he acted in accordance with God’s will, can we not also see that the same is true for us in our continued walk of faith? We are not assured of salvation just by an initial act of obedience, but by continual acting in faith according to God’s word, “Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?”,  v.21 .  What’s the bottom line? None of us will be eternally saved by God’s grace without faith. But this faith that saves by God’s grace is also active and obedient while patiently waiting for God to carry out His purposes through us.","When God promised a son to Abraham and Sarah, they were already old. But they had some faith, so they believed and waited- for a while anyway. However, they eventually decided to “help” God fulfill His promise. They first purposed to adopt the eldest son born in their household (the son of a servant) so that he could become the promised heir. God said this wasn’t the way. So they again waited, at least until Sarah decided she might be the problem, and gave her handmaid to Abraham as a wife so that the heir could be born through her. God reiterated His promise that Abraham and Sarah would have a son. So again, they waited. Then, as promised, Isaac was born, and the nation that was to come from the aged couple had its beginning. What has any of this to do with “The Power of God to Save”?  God said His “power to save” was invested in the gospel. The apostle Paul wrote, “For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation ….”  Romans 1:16 . Perhaps the impatient faith of Abraham and Sarah has some modern equivalents in this regard. Do we really believe and trust God’s word regarding the real power of salvation enough to just keep preaching and teaching the gospel? Or do we instead, like Abraham and Sarah, doubt just enough to be enticed to “help” God accomplish His purposes through our own means and methods? Have we forgotten where God invested His power to save? Is our faith truly strong enough to just obey God and trust Him for the rest?  If our faith is insufficient or impatient, we will turn to and emphasize other means and methods (rather than preaching and teaching the gospel) in feeble attempts to bring the lost to salvation. For instance, we might adopt the fellowship plan of using food and fun to “help” God save the lost: “We’ll attract them with what they want, and then give them what they need later.” Or, we might attempt to meet the physical needs of the lost in order “help” God save their souls: “We’ll help them find a spouse, or educate or entertain their children, then we can teach them the truth.” Or, we might be tempted to use a business model to sell salvation to potential lost customers to “help” God: “In the business world, we do it this way, and it works there- it ought to work to save the lost too.” Or, we might modernize worship so that it appeals to more people in order to “help” God save the lost: “People today want modern music, drama, theatrical lighting, and a worship performance that uplifts their spirits- let’s give them what they want to get them here, then we can teach them the gospel.” Or, (please fill in the blank).  There are a couple of obvious problems with the solutions proposed above. 1) God didn’t provide any of these “solutions” in the Bible. They all come from well-meaning men who had the best of intentions, but who also had impatient faith that lacked trust in God’s word. 2) God said the power of salvation was in “the gospel” rather than in any of these means or methods, “For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation….”  Romans 1:16 .  So, what is the solution? The world is full of souls- including yours and mine, which need the salvation Jesus offers. There is but one real solution, “Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction,”  2Timothy 4:2 . We must return to the Word! We must preach it, we must teach it, and we must exemplify it by living it. The gospel is God’s power to save! We must “give attention to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation and teaching,”  1Timothy 4:15 . While reading the Scriptures in public places is great, Paul was talking about the public place of worship! If the lost are to be saved, our sermons must be filled with “God’s power to save,” rather than being crammed with sacrosanct rhetoric, hypothesized theology, humorous anecdotes, pop-psychology, and the testimonies of celebrities. Let’s start trusting God instead of impatiently trying to “help” him with our ideas and methods. Please, read the Bible, study the Bible, preach the Bible, teach the Bible, and live the Bible- it is still God’s power to save!","“Passive” means that we are not the primary one acting in an event, even though we are present and may participate to some lesser degree. Perhaps this is an over-simplification, but it is the difference between being “active” and being “acted upon.” Many believe that man is entirely “passive” in regard to his own salvation- that he is “acted upon” by God, and has very little, if any, “active” responsibility himself. Let’s see if this is how God saved Noah in the very first case of salvation. Please consider the Word of God with me:  · The world was exceedingly wicked, and God decided to “blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land…”  Genesis 6:5-7 . So far, so good. What’s next?  · “But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord,”  Genesis 6:8 . The word translated “favor” is also accurately rendered as “grace” in some versions. What was it about Noah that set him apart from the rest of the wicked world in the eyes of God?  · “Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his time ; Noah walked with God,”  Genesis 6:9 . It certainly appears that God’s grace was manifested toward Noah because of his righteous obedience to God, in which case Noah was certainly not “passive.” OK, so what did God’s grace do for Noah?  · “Then God said to Noah, ‘The end of all flesh has come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence because of them; and behold, I am about to destroy them with the earth.” The first thing God’s grace did for Noah was to warn him of the coming destruction of the flood. OK, what else did God’s grace do for Noah?  · “Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood….” (God’s grace then gave very specific instructions on exactly how to make the ark), Genesis 6:14-16 . So, the second thing God’s manifested grace did for Noah was to tell him how to prepare for the coming destruction. What else did God’s grace do for Noah?  · “But I will establish my covenant with you….” (God’s grace also gave additional specific instructions regarding who and what Noah should take with him into the ark- his family, animals, and provisions), Genesis 6:17-21 . So, how did Noah respond to God’s manifested grace?  · “Thus Noah did; according to all that God had commanded him, so he did,”  Genesis 6:22 (see also Genesis 7:5 ).  · Then came the rain, and the ensuing flood, “And all flesh that moved on the earth perished, birds and cattle and beasts and every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth, and all mankind; of all that was on the dry land, all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died,”  Genesis 7:21-22 .  Now, let’s recap. Was Noah saved by “grace”? Absolutely! God’s grace warned him of the coming destruction, and told him how to be saved from it. Does Noah’s salvation by grace mean that he was entirely “passive” in regard to it? Having a trusting faith that was willing to: believe God regarding “things not yet seen” ( cf. Hebrews 11: 7; i.e. rain,  Genesis 2:5-6 ); obey God by gathering enough gopher wood to build an ark 450 feet x 75 feet x 45 feet, furnish it with a year’s provisions for yourself, your family, and representative animals of the earth; and then to enter and stay in that ark for a year certainly does not sound “passive,” does it? God surely saved Noah by grace, but such did not exclude Noah’s active obedience in the process. Noah did not “earn” salvation by his works, but he certainly did have to obey God’s commands in order to be saved by His grace.  In response to these things, we might be prone to say, “But that was prior to Christ- we are saved differently today.” Are we? Let’s consider what the apostle Paul wrote, by the inspiration of God, about grace and salvation some 30 years after the death of Jesus, “For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, instructing us to deny ungodliness  and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously , and godly  in the present age , looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus; who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds,”  Titus 2:11-14 . We are saved by God’s grace just like Noah: it warns us of a coming destruction of judgment, and tells us what to do in order to be saved from it! “…the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through by water. And corresponding to that, baptism now saves you…”  1Peter 3:20-21 . Salvation is not simply not “passive”- in fact, as we’ve learned from Noah, it never has been.","Some 700 years before the time of Christ, God’s prophet Isaiah warned of the foolishness and futility of idolatry in clear and remarkable language the logic of which cannot be denied. In Isaiah 44 , he first points out that although a man may plant a tree (or forest), it is God who sends the rain that makes it grow in v.14 . But the reasoning of the next few verses is amazing. The man depicted cuts a tree from this forest and: 1) burns some of it to build a fire for warmth; 2) burns some of it to bake his bread and roast his meat; and, 3) “But the rest of it he mak es into a god, his graven image. He falls down before it and worships; he also prays to it and says, ‘Deliver me, for thou art my god’,”  v.17 . The point is crystal clear: Why would anyone worship and pray to a “god” he himself fashioned from the same tree that he also burned to warm himself and to cook his food? Moreover, why would anyone reasonably expect such a “god” to deliver him from trouble or oppression?  The apostle Paul makes pretty much the same point to the idolatrous Athenians in Acts 17:29 , “Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and thought of man.” Man, as the creation of God, surely should not think that he could create a “god” that is worthy of his adoration and worship!  While there are surely still people in the world who carve a “god” from wood, or form one from some other substance, such are not the most common forms of idolatry today. Instead, many worship the idol of:   Their Own Desires , “For many walk, of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose god is their appetite, and whose glory is in their shame, who set their mind on earthly things,”  Philippians 3:18-19 . The alternative marginal rendering of the word translated as “appetite” is “belly.” He’s not talking about gluttony necessarily, but instead refers to making our own selfish desires into a “god,” and obeying them rather than Jehovah. In reality, this is nothing more than self-worship, and is the height of idolatry.   Mammon,  “No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and Mammon,”  Matthew 6:24 . The rampant consumerism and commercialism of the current world surely must be the result of worshipping Mammon (riches) rather than the Messiah. If you’d like to know if you’re worshipping this particular idol, read the rest of Matthew 6 ( vv.25-34 ), and then ask yourself this question: “Do I really believe and worship God enough to truly ‘seek first His kingdom and His righteousness,’ or is He just a distant second (or third, fourth, etc.) place in my life to money and the things it will buy?   Pleasure,  “If because of the Sabbath, you turn your foot from doing your own pleasure on My holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy day of the Lord honorable, and shall honor it, desisting from your own ways, from seeking your own pleasure, and speaking your own word, then you will take delight in the Lord, and I will make you ride on the heights of the earth; and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken,”  Isaiah 58:13-14 . These words were meant to contrast right and wrong attitudes of worship, and to condemn the idolatry of “pleasure,” to God’s people under the Law of Moses. The Sabbath, God’s “holy day” under that law system, was being corrupted and/or pushed aside for the selfish pursuits of personal pleasure. Though the first day of the week is the day of worship for Christians under the Law of Christ (rather than Saturday/Sabbath, cf. Acts 20:7 ; Revelation 1:10 ), the problem of this particular idolatry persists today. In fact, it may well be the most prevalent form of idolatry practiced. God’s “day” has instead become God’s “hour” for many- and only then if it doesn’t conflict with some other recreational activity or preferred pursuit. Surely, such is idolatry.  Will you worship your Creator, or instead bow to the idols you create of your own desires, money, and pleasure? The latter makes no more sense now than it did when Isaiah wrote about it some 2700 years ago!","“Hearing voices” can be an indication of mental illness or mental health- it all depends on the voices and what they say. For instance, “voices” that urge you to: hurt yourself or others; do things morally reprehensible; or act in ways contrary to sound logic and reason are obviously problematic whatever their source. But what about “voices” that instead urge you to: help yourself and others; act in morally upright and righteous ways; and conduct yourself in reasonable, logical, and sound courses? What “voices” do this?   The Voice of Inspiration.   “All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work,”  2Timothy 3:16-17 . Are you listening to the voice of inspiration for the education and correction it provides to enable you to be useful to God in your life?   The Voice of Reason.   “I urge you there, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship,”  Romans 12:1 . The word translated as “spiritual” in this verse can also be rendered as “rational” (and is given as an alternate in the margins of some versions). What does this mean? It is not only spiritual, but also reasonable to listen to and obey God by living sacrificially for Him instead of selfishly for yourself. Are you listening to His voice of reason in this way?   The Voice of Knowledge.   “I know, O Lord, that a man’s way is not in himself; nor is it in a man who walks to direct his steps,”  Jeremiah 10:23 . There is an obvious arrogance involved when we think we know more or better than our Creator about anything. So, when facing problems and difficulties, or just seeking to navigate through the mazes of life, do you listen to the ultimate voice of knowledge, or assume you have/can get all the needed information yourself?   The Voice of Understanding.   “For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, declares the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts higher than your thoughts,”  Isaiah 55:8-9 . Think about it- there are so many times and circumstances in life that cause us to admit, “I just don’t understand.” But, in how many of those times and circumstances do you appeal to God in prayer for assistance AND look to His word for enlightenment? We may tend to ask for His help, but usually fail to search the answers He has already provided for assistance. Are you listening to the voice of understanding by trying to “see” things the way God does?   The Voice of Wisdom.   “Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom. But if you have bitter jealous and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth. This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but earthly, natural, demonic. For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing. But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy. And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.”  James 3:13-18 . Thus, “true wisdom” is only present when the “right” things are done through it. Are you listening to the voice of wisdom “from above” in righteous conduct, or still struggling to find peace through the wisdom from below (human sources)?  Why not listen to and heed these “voices”? To be sure, there are myriads of “voices” which claim to be those of reason, knowledge, understanding, and wisdom today. However, there is but one voice that really counts- the voice of inspiration! Read your Bible- it contains the reason, knowledge, understanding, and wisdom that matters to eternity.","(For those who may not know, I was diagnosed with Stage 4 T-Cell Lymphoma in May of 2004, but by the grace of God, modern medicine, and the loving support of my families- both physical and spiritual, I’m obviously still hanging around.)  One of the advantages of having been forced to face your own mortality is the perspective it provides. The platitude, \"Live each day as if it could be your last- because one day it will be,\" has only limited effects and benefits toward providing real impetus for changes in perspective and focus. This is especially true in spiritual matters.  As long as death is a known but “distant” reality, contemplating its consequences is pretty much a theoretical rather than a practical endeavor. But, when one is faced with the very real possibility of dying “soon,” if not \"today,\" the practical implications of such dominate the thoughts and perspective in a way that is difficult to achieve otherwise. Facing mortality in an “up close and personal way” inevitably changes the perspective, and subsequently the focus, of what was previously thought of as “life.” Simply put: We think differently about our spiritual life when our physical one has a good chance of ending   today  . There are many emotions that surely come with and through this process. But, the real changes in perspective, focus, and activity come when we are truly \"OK\" with dying TODAY , if such should be. This “comfort level” with death is truly a liberating epiphany, but how do we get to such a life-changing perspective short of receiving a mortal diagnosis?  The ability to think and live comfortably with the “reality of death- even today” is the growth of a part of faith that we don't think or talk about as much as we should. We emphasize the knowledge of faith which is its foundation, Romans 10:17 , “So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” We also underscore the obedience of faith which is its effect, James 2:14-26 , “…Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead….”. But what we typically ignore, or at least fail to accentuate as much as we should, is the trust of faith that is its present benefit. In 2Corinthians 1:8-10 , note that Paul spoke of his afflictions and excessive burdens that were ultimately relieved by his  trust  in God. “For we do not want you to be unaware, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life; indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves in order that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead….He on whom we have set our hope.”   This trust aspect of faith not only pertains to eternal salvation once death has occurred, but also provides present peace and confidence that whatever family and unfinished physical details we leave behind will be graciously cared for and provided for by God and His children. It is this trust aspect of faith that enables our emancipation from the physical constraints of life, and allows our spiritual life to truly develop, grow, and flourish. If our “faith” is only comprised of the knowledge and obedience components, but lacks this trust element, we will live only in the imprisonment of our fear and dread of death. But true “faith” in Jesus delivers “those who through the fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives,”  Hebrews 2:15 . Perhaps this is the primary reason so many of us cling to physical life so tenaciously that we are consumed by its preservation and affairs. Unfortunately, such also renders us incapable of saying (and living) Paul’s words of Colossians 3:1-3 , “If then you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on the earth. For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.”   True biblical faith has knowledge as its base and obedience as its effect, but must also have trust as its current benefit to enable us to live lives that are truly emancipated and spiritual. Think about it, won’t you? And don’t wait for a mortal diagnosis to begin!","Run and hide from an omnipresent God.” Just ask Jonah ( Jonah 1-4 ). God told Jonah to go and urge the great city of Nineveh to repent to avoid complete destruction for their exceeding wickedness. But Jonah viewed the Assyrians, of which Nineveh was the capital city, as Israel’s enemy. So, he attempted to “run and hide” from God’s requirements. Obviously, that didn’t work for a very simple reason: God is everywhere, Psalms 139:7-12 . We simply cannot “run and hide” from the God who is everywhere, or from His requirements of us, Luke 11:30 .   Fight an omnipotent God.” Just ask Pharaoh ( Exodus 7-12 ). The Egyptian king had enslaved and greatly mistreated God’s people. God sent His deliverer, Moses, to Pharaoh with a straightforward command, “Let My people go.” But Pharaoh refused to comply, and tried to fight against the God of heaven. Ten plagues later, when even Pharaoh’s own firstborn son was dead, he relented. But even after Israel left Egypt, Pharaoh changed his mind again, and pursued them. That didn’t work too well either, as God destroyed the Egyptian army in the Red Sea, Exodus 14 . We simply cannot “fight” the all-powerful God.   Outsmart an omniscient God.” Just ask the Christians in Rome. God, through Paul’s inspired letter to them, explained that the ungodly and unrighteous world sought to “suppress the truth,”  Romans 1:18 . To do so, they had to ignore the obvious- the eternal power and the divine nature of God that was clearly evident within the creation, and themselves, vv.19-20 . So, though wise in their own eyes, they became foolish enough to reject the very existence of God, vv.21-22 . This led to rampant idolatry, v.23 , all sorts of depravity, vv.24-31 , and the ultimate rejection of God’s word, v.32 . However, since everyone will be judged by the Word, John 12:48 , they simply could not “outsmart” the all-knowing God- nor can we.   Outlast an eternal God.” In conflicts between men, it is not always the smartest or the strongest that wins- sometimes the ultimate winner is simply the one who outlasts his opponent. Will this tactic work with God? Hardly. Physical man is a mortal and finite being. From his very beginning, everything about him is marked and governed by time. Psalm 90:10 says that our days will be about 70 or 80 years. But God, who is immortal and infinite, is neither marked nor governed by time, vv.1-2 . No, we simply cannot hope to overcome by “outlasting” the eternal God.   “But neither can we…    Exhaust His ability to love.” We typically “love” for selfish reasons- because there is some perceived value in this person to us. But God’s love establishes a value rather than requiring one. Note Romans 5:8 to illustrate, “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were sinners , Christ died for us.” The point is that while we were sinners (or “enemies,”  v.10 ), and therefore contained no inherent value to God, His love  established  sufficient value in us for Him to be willing to sacrifice His Son to save us. Such love is simply inexhaustible. We can, however, miss the benefits of that love by failing to appropriate its sacrifice. We do so by refusing to obey the gospel. But nonetheless, the very essence of God is love, 1John 4:8-10 . Therefore, it cannot be exhausted, for then the eternal God would cease to exist.   Exceed His power to save.” No matter how far we have strayed into sin and depravity- perhaps because of the above mentioned futile attempts to oppose and reject God, we cannot exceed His power to save, Romans 5:20 . God has invested His power to save in the gospel, 1:16 . If we will: in faith turn to Christ, 10:10 ; confess Him as Lord of our lives (which necessarily includes repentance), 10:9 ; and be buried with Him in baptism, 6:3-4 ; then any and all sins, no matter how heinous or depraved, can and will be forgiven, 6:5-7 . Just ask Saul of Tarsus, cf. 1Timothy 1:13-14 .  It makes no sense whatsoever to oppose and reject an omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient, and eternal God. But, why would we want  to oppose and reject a God whose love for us inexhaustible, and His ability to save us we are unable to exceed? So instead of opposing and rejecting Him, why not reciprocate His love by trusting and obeying Him?","I seriously doubt that Pilate meant the question he asked Jesus, shortly before surrendering Him to the Jews for crucifixion, to be anything other than rhetorical. But even if the Roman Governor was not really looking for a reply, it is a question that currently needs to be asked and answered.  Please carefully consider this statement: “While ‘truth’ can be discerned by men, and they can decide to follow or reject it, they never determine it- God does that.” This statement goes against the grain of modern religion. Men today meet in conventions, councils, and synods in efforts to “determine” rather than to “discern” truth- and in fact, have been doing so for hundreds of years. These efforts will always be futile for a number of important reasons we would do well to consider.   Truth is eternal, Isaiah 40:8  . “The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God stands forever.” While man, like grass and flowers , is a finite creature, the truth of God’s word remains firmly infinite throughout our generations. This means “truth” doesn’t change, evolve, or need updating to “keep up” with man. It is man that must conform to God’s word, not the other way around, Romans 12:2 .   Truth is divine, John 14:6  . Jesus said He was “the truth.” Not only is He the embodiment of “truth” ( John 1:14 ), He, as God, is the Author of it, John 8:31-32 . Therefore, men neither determine nor dictate “truth,” they just discern it, or fail to do so, and decide to obey it, or fail to do so.  There are also a couple of conclusions implied from these things that we cannot escape.   Truth is not relativeto time   . It is not relativeto time, or the occupants of any time period. God determines the “right” of righteousness and the “sin” of sinfulness. We can’t decide to “call evil good, and good evil” ( Isaiah 5: 20) because we think the changes of time dictate such. God, in every generation, has demanded that man simply believe and obey Him. This was true of Noah, Abraham, Israel, and Peter, as well as Paul, and it is true for us also, James 2:14-26 .   Truth is not relative to man’s understanding of it (or lack thereof) .   2Thessalonians 1:8 makes this clear when it states that “retribution” will be forthcoming to “those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.” The next verse adds that “these (the unknowing and the disobedient from the previous verse) will pay the penalty of eternal destruction….”. Just like in civil matters, ignorance of the laws of God does not excuse violation of them, cf. Acts 17:30 . Also understand that two men do not “understand the truth differently.” One may “understand” and one may “misunderstand,” or both may “misunderstand,” but both do not “understand” it differently. This is so because truth is not relative to our understanding of it. It remains “truth” whether we understand and apply it correctly or not.   Truth is not relative to man’s acceptance of it (or lack thereof) .  The truth remains “the truth” whether men of any time period accept it or not. It doesn’t change because men of a certain time period, mindset, or morality reject and refuse to obey it. Therefore, efforts to modernize the truth of God’s word by making it “less offensive” to our current sensibilities, mindset, and morality, or to make it “more acceptable” to the masses, is fatally flawed. There is a simple reason for this- truth that is distorted ( see Galatian 1:6-10 ) no longer saves. Note Jesus’ words of truth on this point, “If you abide in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine; and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free,”  John 8:31b-32 .  Pilate asked the right question, “What is truth?” ( John 18:38 ), even if he didn’t really expect or desire an answer. In fact, Jesus had already answered the question before it was asked. He had just said, “My kingdom is not of this world,”  v.36 . Since the kingdom of Christ is not  of this world   , neither does  this world  determine “the truth” on which that kingdom stands. Thus, we humans neither  determine  nor  dictate  “truth.” We need to, instead, confine ourselves to discerning and deciding to obey the truth that God has already determined and dictated!","The so-called “Lord’s Prayer” really isn’t His. He taught and gave it to the disciples for their use, Matthew 6:5-9a (one of His prayers is recorded in John 17:1-26 , and is very different). The prayer is not a formula to be ritualistically recited,but it does contain a form that preaches as well as it petitions. For instance, note that the prayer includes:  · A  spiritual salutation  that recognizes and praises the greatness of God, v.9 ;  · A  spiritual plea  for God’s will and purposes to be done everywhere, v.10 ;  · A  physical petition  for only daily sustenance, v.11 ;  · A  spiritual supplication  for forgiveness that also requires us to think, feel, and act the way we would like God to think, feel, and act toward us, v.12 ; and,  · A  spiritual entreaty  for God’s protection and deliverance from temptation and evil, v.13 .  What’s missing in this prayer? Think about our own current prayers. Are they more like this model, or do they sound more like we’re presenting “our list” to some sort of celestial Santa Claus version of God? Are our petitions filled with physical requests for everything under the sun to make our life here the way “we” want it to be, or are they filled with spiritual requests for “God’s will” to be done in our lives, and only include the physical necessities of life? Which dominates our prayers: spiritual concerns and desires, or physical requests ?   Certainly we are to pray for, and recognize our dependence upon God for, physical things, Matthew 6:25-32 . But, doesn’t this passage also teach that spiritual concerns, needs, and requirements should dominate and come first, cf. vv.19-24, 33-34 ? So why don’t spiritual things comprise at least the majority of our thoughts, desires, and prayers (if indeed they don’t)? There are probably a number of reasons for this, and not all of them are necessarily indicting. Consider a couple of them.  1. We are physical creatures that, although we possess an immortal/eternal soul, live in a mortal/finite world. This is not an excuse; it’s just our current reality. But, it is a reality that has both a temporary escape and permanent end,  2Peter 2:4 ; 3:8-13 .  2. We are selfish. While upon the earth, everything Jesus Christ did was for us. He selflessly lived and died for us. If we are to truly be His disciples (followers), we must learn to pattern our lives after His selflessness and away from our own selfishness,  cf. Galatians 2:20 ; 6:14  . Simply put: We can live for self, or we can live for Him and others. An integral part of discipleship is self-denial,  Matthew 16:24 ; unfortunately for many of us, it is the most difficult part. And our prayer life reflects it. So, we wind up presenting “our” list to God in prayer of all the things “we” want and think would make our lives all that “we” want them to be. The consequence of these things is that “Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven” is rarely mentioned, and even less often really meant. It doesn’t have to be this way!  Let’s all decide to make 2014 different. Let’s acknowledge (and confess if need be) that:  1. God is God, and I’m not Him, Philippians 3:19 ;  2. He knows what is best for me and everyone else, and I do not, Isaiah 55:8-9 ;  3. His will is therefore better and more important than my will, Jeremiah 10:23 ; and so,  4. I will want and I will pray for His will to be done instead of mine, Matthew 6:10 .  Now, wouldn’t these things necessarily make 2014 a better year? I think so. Let’s give them a try, and be sure to include “Thy will be done, on earth (and in my life) as it is in heaven” in our thoughts and prayers- and let’s mean it too!","What we usually refer to as “common knowledge” is often “common” (shared), but is rarely “knowledge” (true/factual). Perhaps this is nowhere more evident than in regard to “common knowledge” of the Scriptures. Perhaps a few examples will help to illustrate the point. Many have said or believed such “common knowledge” precepts as…   “Cleanliness is next to godliness.” I suspect this was first introduced by, and rapidly became “common knowledge” to, mothers who struggled to keep their families clean. However, this well-known adage is not in the Scriptures (sorry moms!). Perhaps the closest biblical text dealing with this issue can be found in Matthew 15:1-20 . Here, Pharisees (a hypocritical and self-righteous sect of the Jews during Christ’s time) accused Jesus’ disciples of violating God’s Law because they ate with unwashed hands, v.2 . Rather than condemning His disciples, Jesus instead indicts the Pharisees for adding their own requirement to God’s Law (since God never said it). He went on to say that spiritual defilement didn’t come from such external things, but the internal uncleanness of the heart, vv.17-20 . Given that God’s thoughts and ways are much higher than our own, cf. Isaiah 55:8-9 , we should all pay attention to what God has actually said, and stop adding to it or taking from it, Revelation 22:18-19 .   “If we would just keep the Ten Commandments, everything would be better and we could all go to heaven.” What do the Scriptures actually say? The Ten Commandments were given to Jewish people (direct physical descendants of Abraham) living in the time period between the giving of the Law of Moses at Mt. Sinai and the cross of Jesus, cf. Exodus 19:1-8 and Hebrews 9:15-17 . Though most of the Ten Commandments are repeated in, and thus made a part of, the Law of Christ (New Testament), the Law of Moses (Old Testament) was actually only given to the nation of Israel living during that time period. In fact, Jewish Christians in the region of Galatia who tried to appeal to the Law of Moses were told they had “fallen from grace,”  Galatians 5:4 . So, we can’t “go to heaven by keeping the Ten Commandments.” God invested His power to save in the gospel of Jesus Christ, Romans 1:16 , not the Ten Commandments.   “The truth shall set you free.” This is often quoted in a multitude of circumstances, but is probably not true in most applications typically implied. Although the quote does come from the Bible, this is not all of it. The full sentence of Jesus, recorded in John 8:31-32 , is, “If you abide in My word, then are you truly disciples of Mine; and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.” The “freedom” of which Jesus spoke is spiritual freedom from the consequences of eternal damnation, not the various applications usually made. Furthermore, this spiritual freedom was not based solely on the truth itself. Jesus began the sentence with “if”. The truth only sets us free “if” we meet the conditions stated in the rest of the sentence. Note that Jesus said one must: “ abide in My word” (be obedient to it), and thus become a “ disciple ” of His(follower, a Christian), by “ know (ing) the truth” (can’t obey or follow without knowledge) in order to be made “free” by the truth. So the “truth” that makes one “free” is the “word” of Jesus that is “known” and “obeyed” and “followed”! Anything less doesn’t result in spiritual freedom.   “Jesus is the reason for the season.” The birth of Jesus was certainly a momentous event in human history. Do you really know why? God is eternal and thus cannot die. Since God planned and desired to “give His only begotten Son” to shed His bloodas a sacrifice for our sin, Jesus would need a human body- one that could die, Ephesians 1:3-7 . Thus, Jesus became God incarnate (in the flesh), Colossians 2:9 . So far, so good- but, despite being “common knowledge” that Jesus was born on December 25 th , and that we’re supposed to celebrate Christmas to remember and honor His birth, the Bible does not say either of these things. God knows how to tell time and read a calendar, but chose not to reveal the date of Jesus’ birth. And, neither God nor Jesus, or the Holy Spirit-inspired writers of the New Testament, ever intimated that Christians should memorialize Christ’s birth. However, we are told to memorialize His death, which His birth obviously enabled, Matthew 26:26-29 . This N.T. Christians did on the first day of every week as the Jesus and the Holy Spirit taught, Acts 20:7 ; 1Corinthians 11:18-34 .  There is nothing necessarily wrong with cleanliness, the Ten Commandments, the freedom that truth provides, or the celebration of “Christmas,” but let’s remember to read and practice what the Bible actually says, in the way that it says, rather than depending on “common knowledge,” OK?","Have you ever wondered what would happen if our spiritual mistakes had physical consequences? Since God’s laws and discipline is “for our good, that we may share His holiness” ( Hebrews 12:10b ), some sins certainly do have physical consequences, but not all of them do. But what if they all did? Not anything huge, just an uncomfortable “thump on the head” or “zap” electric shock to the fingertips? We’re tempted to think that could be a “good” deterrent- that it would help me not to sin if there was an immediate physical consequence to my poor choices and bad activities. Or, on the flipside, we might also think it would be easier to make good spiritual choices if there were an immediate physical benefit attached. However, if we think this through, there are “good” reasons that this is a “bad” idea- besides a head full of knots and charred fingertips….   It’s Pavlovian. Pavlov “trained” a dog to respond to conditions by ringing a bell just before food was dispensed. Eventually, each time the dog heard a bell ring he would begin to salivate. While this was a positively induced “conditioned response,” there can be negative ones as well. If you rub a puppy’s nose in his urine, spank his bottom, and put him outside every time he pees on the floor, he soon becomes “conditioned” to behave differently. (Please don’t tell me this is not the way to “house-train” a dog- it’s just an example.) If our spiritual choices are just a conditioned response, we’re no more than “spiritual dogs” (with apologies to canines), cf. Matthew 7:6 ; 2Peter 2:22 ; Revelation 22:15 .   It’s Quid Pro Quo. The phrase “quid pro quo” is derived from New Latin (first known use was 1582), and translates as “something for something.” Basically, it’s the same as the old “You scratch my back, and I’ll scratch yours” idea. But is this really how we want to operate with God? After the Babylonian captivity and return to Judea, some of the Israelites seemed to base their spiritual choices on this method. God addressed their thought processes through His prophet Malachi ( 3:14 ), “You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept His charge, and that we have walked in mourning before the Lord of hosts?’” When we think this way, it is pretty well certain that: 1) we’re not nearly as “faithful” as we think, cf. Malachi 3:1-13 ; and, 2) God has already blessed us so abundantly we can never “catch up” or “equal” His graciousness and magnanimity, Malachi 3:10 .   It’s Immature. Children want what they want now. At least part of what makes them “children” is the unwillingness to put off the perceived present benefits associated with “instant gratification” for future blessings. If the only reason we make “good” choices is for this kind of “instant gratification” reward, or to avoid the immediate negative consequences, we are spiritually immature, 1Corinthians 3:1-3 . On the other hand, if we are able to realize that even “good” choices may have immediate negative consequences now, but hold the key to future benefits of unfathomable proportions (heaven), and still make the right choices, then we are on the right track to spiritual maturity, cf. Hebrews 11:32-40 !  As parents, we want our children to learn to make “good” choices and do “the right thing,” not because there is some immediate benefit to doing so, or because there is an immediate negative consequence for failure. We want our children to learn to make “good” choices and do “the right thing” because these things are “good” and “right”- regardless of the immediate consequences. Guess what? We learned this from God. This is exactly why He wants us to be “good” and do “right” too! He wants us to obey Him not from any direct connection to immediate consequence, but because we love Him, John 14:15 ; because we want to please Him, Ephesians 5:10 ; and because we want to “be” good rather than just receiving the rewards of good “behavior,” Romans 12:2 . Now let’s see if we can “grow up” and serve God, rather than ourselves.","This article is not about child rearing, per se. The spiritual condition of your physical children is not its focus. Instead, please consider spiritual children in the light of 1Corinthians 4:15 where Paul wrote, “For if you were to have countless tutors in Christ, yet you would not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.”  This is precisely the meaning intended.  Having physical children changes us. Perhaps for the first time in our lives, we learn what true, selfless love is really all about. Up to that point, we’ve probably lived mostly for ourselves. But that little “bundle of joy” hopefully brings about major changes in our minds with regard to how we think, our hearts with regard to how we feel, and our lives with regard to how we conduct ourselves. Such is natural and good, because if we haven’t done so yet, these changes force us to grow up or mature. But this is in the physical realm- what about spiritual children?   Having spiritual children, in the sense of which Paul wrote to the Corinthians, instead of forcing us to grow up spiritually, is most often the  result  of spiritual maturity. Think about the comparison. In the physical (purely biological) realm, the life-cycle typically is as follows: 1) Seed Implantation; 2) Conception; 3) Gestation; 4) Birth; 5) Growth/Development; 6) Maturity; 7) Reproduction; 8) Parental Care of Offspring; and finally, 9) Death. But some how, in the spiritual realm, we tend to associate maturity simply with chronology since birth, rather than with reproduction and the parental care given to spiritual offspring. The reason for this is very simple. Most Christians never become spiritual parents becausethey never reproduce themselves spiritually!   Without this spiritual maturity (either from or because of having spiritual children ), we don’t get that all-so-important change of mind with regard to how we think in spiritual terms . We don’t get that vital change of heart with regard to how we feel in spiritual terms. And, we don’t get that imperative change of life with regard to how we live and conduct ourselves in spiritual terms. Basically, we never really “grow up” spiritually! Paul also addressed this issue to the Corinthians, “And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men , but…. as to babes in Christ,”   1Corinthians 3:1ff  . Even a casual read of 1Corinthians leaves us with the indelible impression that most, if not all, of their “problems” were directly tied to their selfish spiritual immaturity.  Please think this through. How many current congregational/church problems would be resolved if the membership were, at least in part, spiritual parents (had spiritual children in the congregation)? Wouldn’t we be more tolerant and understanding of the mistakes children typically make if they were our  spiritual children, or the spiritual children of family members ,  1Thessalonians 5:14  ? Wouldn’t we be more careful with regard to what we (and others) say about church leadership or other family members when the immature ears of our  spiritual children were listening, 1Thessalonians 5:12-13 ? Wouldn’t we be more concerned with how we treat one another in front of our  spiritual children,  1Thessalonians 5:15 ? Wouldn’t we be more diligent with regard to the growth and development opportunities within the congregation if it included our  spiritual children,  Hebrews 12:14-17 ?  I’m not suggesting that having “babes in Christ” in the congregation will solve every problem that arises in a local fellowship. I am suggesting that: 1) spiritual maturity is not the mere product of years of wearing out pew cushions, but should instead be associated with the maturity necessary to produce and rear spiritual children; 2) reproducing ourselves spiritually helps us to become selflessly mature rather than remaining selfishly immature; and, 3) when congregations are comprised of significant numbers of spiritual parents , many of the problems arising from spiritual immaturity (most congregational problems) aren’t allowed to fester and destroy the faith of their spiritual children.  There is one more point that deserves consideration. When physical parents have two children, the overall population will remain static because they’ve simply replaced themselves. The same is true in the spiritual realm if we convert only our “two” physical children. Furthermore, if we content ourselves to be spiritually barren, the kingdom of God on earth is on a path of diminishing returns that nears extinction with each passing generation.","There seems to be a growing disappointment manifested by “older folks” (pre, present, and some post “Baby Boomers”) toward “younger folks” (whatever Generation name is utilized- X, Y, Z, Millennial, etc.) First, let’s all admit the truth of the old axiom about acorns, or nuts as the case may be, not falling very far from the tree. Whatever faults of character or tendencies that the “younger generation” manifests are surely the product of the influences of us “older” folks. Whether genetically or environmentally, we were the trees that produced the acorns!   Therefore, where they fall is largely up to us. It was “our job” as fathers (and mothers and grandparents) to “bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord,”  Ephesians 6:4 ; Titus 2:4-5 . Even outside the spiritual realm, we “adults” have to accept responsibility for that which we have produced or encouraged in them- even if it was done by neglect of duties and lack of guidance. I’m not, however, suggesting I agree that anything is necessarily “wrong” with “the younger generation.” They have their obstacles to overcome, and both assets and liabilities with which to do so, as has had each previous generation. Besides, I’m not about to bash the “younger generation”- I may need their help with my cell phone or internet connection!  But these things notwithstanding, give some contemplative time to this: “If young adults pick and attend a college or university for social rather than educational reasons, they will probably be very popular dropouts.” Why is this? The reasons for “going to college” matter- in fact, probably more than anything else, they determine the “success” of the venture. If secondary education is secondary to social environment and socializing in that environment, true “education” rarely occurs. That’s not hard to predict or see, but let’s follow this thread just a little further.  How did “young people” get to the point of viewing higher education mainly as a social opportunity? Could it be that we “older folks” encouraged this perspective by catering primary education to social influences instead of insisting that education be primary? Didn’t we attempt to make education “fun” to the point that learning and knowing became subordinate to “enjoyable” and “socially acceptable”? We even allowed incremental promotions to be based on “social” factors rather than academic achievement. What did this teach “younger folks” to expect and desire?  Now, if you’re still reading, Thank-you. All of this hasn’t been written to lay blame at the proper feet for whatever generational failures that exist (or that we may think exist) in education or otherwise. There is a spiritual point that has been the intended objective of these observations and illustrations. Much like attending college, “going to church” has very poor results when we have the wrong motivations. If, because of similar experiences and past influences, we have come to view “social” purposes as the primary reason to attend church services, we, too, will likely miss the real opportunities and true purposes of the activity. In spiritual terms, we will probably also (or again?) become very socially popular dropouts. Or perhaps even worse, we will attempt to change the purposes for “worship” (praising God) and “bible study” (spiritual education) into something more socially pleasing (feel-good fun). The apostle Paul predicted this in 2Timothy 4:3-4 , “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance with their own desires; and will turn away their ears from the truth, and will turn aside to myths.”   So, how do we “fix” this? 1) We realize and accept that “worship” is first and foremost about praising God rather than pleasing ourselves, Hebrews 13:15 . 2) We realize and accept that “bible study” is first and foremost about spiritual education (learning what the bible teaches) rather than social enjoyment, 2Timothy 3:16-17 ; Ephesians 4:11-16 . 3) We realize and accept that although “worship” and “bible study” have social benefits that  result  from assembling with those of “like precious faith” and common spiritual goals,these social benefits cannot be made the  objective  of these activities and still remain true to God’s spiritual purposes, 1Corinthians 11:20-30 . The “success rate” is much better in college and church when we attend for the right reasons. Think about it, please.","Donna and I were watching an old movie together on a rainy day recently when an advertisement came on for a major department store. At the end of the commercial, I noted that they would open at 8 PM on Thanksgiving Day. I asked Donna when they would close if they opened that late. She said they probably wouldn’t close- that they would likely be open all night heading into the follow day’s shopping frenzy. Then it hit us: Isn’t it amazing that we spend a few hours being “thankful” for what we have, then we can’t wait to finish up our “Thanksgiving” so we can rush out, compete (and sometimes fight, from what I understand), and run ourselves crazy in a feeding frenzy of shopping to get more stuff? Does this seem at least somewhat ironic, if not downright hypocritical to anyone else? (And just for the record, we tend to avoid crowds {except at church services!} - especially the piranha-type ones on “Big Sale” days.)  True thankfulness is linked in the Scriptures to contentment. There are a couple of N.T. passages that emphasize the importance of  contentment   - being satisfied (and happy) with what God has given us, see Philippians 4:11-13 and 1Timothy 6:6-8 . It is not coincidental that both of these passages are preceded in their contexts by verses that emphasize the importance of  thanksgiving   - obviously, being appreciative to God in prayer . Please note Philippians 4:6 , “Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God,” and also, 1Timothy 2:1 , “First of all, then, I urge that entreaties and prayers, petitions and thanksgivings , be made on behalf of all men…”. The point is that unless we are first  thankful for what we have, we will never enjoy the true blessing of contentment. And, if we don’t, we may continue “going through the motion” of being thankful, but will never reach contentment, which is really at least part of the point.  Please don’t misunderstand. I’m not suggesting that looking forward to and going shopping after Turkey-Day festivities is wrong, I’m just wanting us to stop and think for a moment or two about a couple of significant questions. “Are you/I really ‘thankful’ for the blessings God gives us?” And, “Have we learned the lessons of ‘contentment’ that deepen our thankfulness into true appreciation and trust?”  If you’re not sure whether or not you are truly thankful for and content with God’s blessings, consider 1Timothy 6:8   personally,   “And if we have food and covering, with these we shall be content.” What if “food” meant simply something to eat, instead of “turkey with all the trimmings” and every kind of side dish and dessert imaginable? And, what if “covering” meant clothes on your back and/or a roof over your head , instead of a new “thanksgiving outfit” and a $100,000 home furnished to the hilt? Would you still be “content” then? Could you be “thankful” then? Are these fair questions? Perhaps not, but they are questions we probably all would do well to soberly consider.  Think one step further with me. Matthew 6:33 says that if we “seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness,” that all these things (food, drink, covering) “will be added to you.” Do we really believe that? Do we really trust God enough to do what He said- to have Him and spiritual matters truly as the first and primary focus of our lives? Or, do we instead spend most of our time, energy, efforts, and concern on providing these essentials for ourselves? Even to the point that we push aside spiritual matters because we’re “too busy” with the material pursuits? Such surely isn’t trust, faith, contentment, or thankfulness.  God has surely blessed most of us far beyond our needs even to our wants, if not our luxuries. Let’s be content with whatever He has given us to the point of being truly thankful by putting Him first in our lives.","Bro. Dean Bullock (aka “the Beloved” and “Judge” by some) passed away this past week. I suppose I knew him just about all of my life- like so many other church folks throughout East Texas, and across the state and country. Perhaps as much as anyone else, Dean was responsible for me becoming a “preacher,” at least to the degree that such has occurred. So, now you know whom to blame! More seriously, he was my preacher (while he did local work in the congregation where I grew up), my teacher (while I worked and studied with him in Lufkin), my “agent” (for years he would call me every two or three years to see if I wanted to move to some other “good work” he knew about), my father in the faith (as he showed me what a “preacher” was and did) my brother in Christ (which is most important of all), and my friend (who I will always cherish). But this isn’t going to be tearful recitation of this noble servant’s life. Dean had a great, and very dry, sense of humor. So, let me relay one of his favorite stories, and hopefully make an appropriate point from it.  Dean proudly hailed from the tiny town of Alto, Texas. When he was young, he joined the Navy. Some of his favorite “tales” came from those younger years in Alto, or his time in the Navy. He loved to tell about one of his buddies from Alto who was also in the service (I never knew whether this “buddy” was real or fictitious). This friend asked a passing serviceman, “Hey buddy, whereya from?” The man replied proudly, “I’m from New York city!” Dean’s friend answered quite matter-of-factly, “Is that right?” “Yes sir,” the man responded, “Where are you from?” Dean’s friend immediately stood, poked out his chest as far as he could, and said with great pride, “I’m from Alto Texas!” “Really?” the passerby asked, “I’ve heard of Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and Corpus, but I don’t think I’ve ever heard of Alto.” “Oh, that’s OK,” Dean’s friend said slyly, looking down and kind of kicking at the ground while also peeking back with one eye, “There’s folks in Alto that have never heard of New York city!” (Apologies are hereby tendered to the current residents of Alto, all of which I’m certain know of New York, and some of which have been there.)  Hometown pride is a good thing, but just about every hometown has its good points and its not-so-good points. Hopefully, we can have the good nature to accept these things, and joke about and overcome them as necessary. Most of us are proud of “where we came from” regardless of whatever shortcomings it may have. And many of us, no matter where we’ve been, what we’ve done, and how we’ve lived, want to return “home” at the end of our lives- whether to live out our remaining days, or to “rest” until the Lord’s final call. But for the faithful Christian, things are a little bit different…  “Home” or “hometown” for the Christian means something different, something more- much more. Christians understand heaven to be their “hometown,” though they’ve never been there, except in the mind and eternal presence of God. They long to go “home” to that city from which they spiritually originate. They long to go “home” to be with their spiritual Parent, Brother, and family. Earthly ties of friends, family, and places are strong, but pale in comparison to the desire to go “home.” The swelling pride of their eternal “hometown” of heaven is not arrogant or boastful, but is an ever-present, sweet, and earnest longing. Philippians 3:20-21 , “For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ; who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.”   We can all be proud of our physical hometowns - regardless of their grandeur or humbleness, but Christians should be proud (in a good way) of our spiritual hometown of heaven; and more than anything else, long to go there. I will surely miss my friend, but I can’t mourn for the Beloved, he’s simply gone “home” to the place he longed to be much more than even his beloved Alto. Oh, that we can all be so blessed!","I suppose the recent tragic typhoon in the Philippines got me to thinking about it, but for years people of faith, and who certainly mean well, have quoted Romans 8:28 to comfort themselves or others when some terrible thing has happened. The application is typically that God causes even terrible events to have good outcomes if patience and trust are present. Please note this verse carefully, “And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.” Let’s consider this verse and its context a little closer to see if it really promises all that some might expect, or in the way they expect.   The promise of this verse is limited to “those who love God” and those who “are called according to His purpose.”  It is not universal in its scope. The chapter began a consideration of blessings and promises given to those “in Christ Jesus,”  vv.1ff . So, the promise of v.28 must be limited to “those who love God” and “who are called according to His purpose” who are also “in Christ.” This means that they have done, and continue to do, those things that put them in Christ,  cf. Galatians 3:26-29 (faith and baptism) and 1John 2:3-6 (keeping His commandments).   The promise of this verse is limited by the “all things” God has specifically in mind. Logic and the harmony of the Scriptures demand that “all things” is necessarily limited. Does the “all things” which God causes to work together for good include Satan, or his agents, or the sinful actions of self or others? Of course it doesn’t, for although God is certainly powerful enough to control Satan and to prevent the sinful actions of people from having disastrous consequences, He allows us the freedom to choose whom we will obey, Romans 6:16-21 . When we allow Satan to influence us to make bad decisions and sinful actions, bad things can and do happen. And the physical consequences of such are often irreversible. For example, if I decide to drink and drive, and kill a young mother in so doing, her husband is without a wife and her children without a mother, and I will likely spend the rest of my life behind bars. Is God then responsible for making “good” things to come from my sinful choices and activities? Such is not the promise of this verse.  So, what are we to conclude that “all things” of the verse includes? Note the spiritual helps that have already been listed in the chapter: Spiritual Freedom from condemnation through the “law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus,”  vv.1-4 ; Spiritual Guidance from the Spirit’s inspired provision of “the Law of God,”  vv.2,5-14 ; Spiritual Adoption/Validation as children of God through the Spirit’s witness,  vv.16-17 ; Spiritual Hope of eternal salvation that sustains us during the “sufferings of this present time,”  vv.18-25 ; and Spiritual Intercession by the Spirit in prayerto the Father, vv.26-27 . Why not understand “all things” of v.28 to be referring to these  spiritual helps  which have already been listed in the text under consideration, rather than trying to make them apply to every conceivable physical force, circumstance, and thing? Thus…   The promise of this verse is limited to the spiritual helps God has promised to those who love and obey Him. He has promised spiritual salvation, spiritual adoption, spiritual hope, and spiritual intercession to those who love and obey Him, but has not promised that physical “good” will come from bad circumstances brought about by evil influences and choices.   The promise of this verse is limited to what God determines and calls “good.”  Neither this verse, nor any other, obligates God to cause what we might deem “good” to occur for us (which usually relates to physical things ),even if we do love and obey Him. Remember that all but one of the apostles suffered tremendous persecutions and were killed for their faith! The simple fact is that we are not good determiners of what is “good” for us in the first place, Jeremiah 10:23 ; Isaiah 5:20 . Instead of the applications that are typically made of Romans 8:28 toward physical good as we see it, please realize that God  is  promising that all the spiritual helps He has provided will effect our  spiritual  and eternal good no matter what physical suffering or tragedy we encounter in life-  if  we use them to continue love, trust, and obey Him.","Take an imaginary, but-all-too-real, journey with me. Imagine that we’re all assembled at church services on Sunday morning. It is that time just before the first prayer or song leader (or announcement maker) rises and moves to the front of the auditorium to start the service. You know- that time when the noisy clamoring of cheerful greetings and polite inquiries fill the building because we’re all really glad to see one another on such a beautiful Lord’s Day. And then suddenly, in just that moment that the crowd falls silent in preparation for the beginning worship, the projector flashes to life all on its own. The image on the screen is much clearer and brighter than normal, and….  A picture of Ashley Adams (this “Ashley Adams” is completely fictitious, as are all of the characters which follow in our imaginary story) dissolves onto the screen. Everyone oohs and aahs over the picture-perfect portrait displayed. But then something very different and dreadful happens- actual photos begin to flash on the screen one by one of every sin Ashley ever committed. Every trite or catty thought, every smug or careless or unkind or hateful word, every secret sexual lust and sin- pictures that capture every sinful thought and word and deed, begin to parade across the projector screen before our eyes! Hundreds of photos seamlessly chronicle every iniquity, every poor choice, every thoughtless word, every lustful emotion, and every sinful moment of her life. We sit in stunned disbelief and shocked silence as these images flicker before us. Everyone, even those who have been victims of her sometimes-sharp tongue, feel so sorry for poor Ashley! Despite heroic efforts by several of the men to shut down the projector, nothing seems to work. Since it is mounted on the ceiling, and appears to be divinely powered and directed, there’s really nothing that can be done to stop this deeply painful recitation of Ashley’s “other” life. She sits in horrified embarrassment, sobbing uncontrollably as everyone sees all the ugliness that she has so adeptly kept hidden under the shiny façade of her “Christian” life for years. But then it gets worse, much worse.  When Ashley’s train-wreck of shame finally concludes with her most recent displays of depravity, the screen goes momentarily blank. Everyone sighs deeply; grateful the tragically painful presentation appears to be over. An aghast hush creeps through the audience, which is inexplicably larger than normal. Those sitting around Ashley try to console her, but everyone else just sits silently- wondering what to do next. Then, slowly, another image begins to appear on the screen. It seems like several minutes, but isn’t more than a few seconds until Ben Baker’s visage gradually comes into focus on the projector screen. The spectacle of sin begins again, chronicling every single iniquity of Brother Baker’s life, beginning with his teenage years and progressively moving forward through to just last week, starts to unfold- slide by stunning slide. If the images of the young and beautiful, but sometimes a little “wild,” Ashley shocked the audience, there are no words adequate to describe our utter dismay at the decadent degradation now displaying on the screen of one of our longtime Elder’s life! Surely this couldn’t get worse, but it did…  Gradually, after Brother Baker’s “show” ended and Cade Conner’s started, it began to dawn on us: This display of depravity is going through the church directory in alphabetical order! Now, shock and horror turns to dread as one by one we realize that this “show” is eventually going to put our own “secret sins” up on the screen for everyone to see. Just imagine!  Now, this story, and the characters in it, is completely fictitious. But, realize that a similar scenario is depicted in 1Corinthians 14:22-25 . In fact, this passage was the “inspiration” (excuse the pun!) of the story. However, neither the plausibility nor the possibility of such actually occurring today is really the point. What is? There are a few I’d like you to consider with me briefly.  1) God already knows our “secret sins.” However adept we may be at “hiding” our sins from others, He knows not only our actions, but also the innermost thoughts and desires of our hearts, Hebrews 4:12-13 .  2) We all have sins for which we need forgiveness. While we certainly may have sinned against others, and need seek their forgiveness, every sin we commit is against God and demands His forgiveness first and foremost, 2Samuel 11 ; 12:12-13 .  3) Perhaps most importantly, there are no sins too big or too numerous for God’s grace, 1Timothy 1:14 . He has promised Christians that if we will confess our sins to Him, and repent of them, He will “cleanse us from  all  unrighteousness,”  1John 1:6-10 .  All of which should cause us to better understand His grace , mercy , and love ; and to be so very thankful for His willingness to  remember our sins no more   ,  Hebrews 8:12 !","Think about this list: nets, a boat, homes and families, farms, a job, a water pot, homeland/country, and personal freedom/safety. What do all of these things have in common? They were all “left” in the pursuit of truth, salvation, and a right relationship with God.  In this pursuit of spiritual interests: Peter and Andrew left their nets (tools of trade), Matthew 4:18-20 ; James and John left their boat (fishing business), Matthew 4:21-22 ; the twelve disciples left their homes and families,  Matthew 19:27,29 , and farms,  Mark 10:29 ; Levi left a lucrative job (collecting taxes), Luke 5:27-28 ; the woman at the well left her water pot (immediate task), John 4:28 ; Abraham left his home, country, and family, Acts 7:3-4 ; and Paul left his personal freedom and safety, 2Corinthians 11:23-33 . All of which begs two important questions. 1) What have you left to follow Jesus? And, 2) What are you willing to leave to continue to follow Him?  In answer to the first question, “What have you left to follow Jesus”, many of us are extremely blessed in that we didn’t have to leave our families or jobs to become Christians. We were born into families that were believers, or were perhaps led to Christ by a boss or co-worker. We were likewise not required to leave our country, or even our personal freedom and safety. All we really had to leave were our sinful ways and habits- and these were actually hurting us anyway, Proverbs 13:15 (KJV).  But the second question- “What are you willing to leave to continue to follow Jesus?” is an entirely different matter. Jesus told a rich young ruler that he needed to \"go and sell your possessions and give to the poor….and follow Me,”  Matthew 19:21 . Jesus knew this man’s heart, and because He loved him ( Mark 10:21 ), told him what he needed, but did not want to hear. This story well-illustrates the principle that Jesus had previously relayed in Matthew 6:21 , “for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” The conclusion of the story is that instead of following Jesus as invited, the young man “went away grieved; for he was one who owned much property,”  Matthew 19:22 . The “owning” of the property wasn’t necessarily the problem. It was his trusting in and valuing the property more than he did a right relationship with Jesus that was problematic. But what about it- would Jesus say the same thing to us? And more importantly, would we feel and act the way this young man did, or more resemble the saints mentioned in Hebrews 10:34 ? That’s a tough question! How can we know the answer?  Since Jesus also said, “He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much” ( Luke 16:10 ), perhaps there are smaller indicators that will help us to know how we would react to such a requirement (and whether or not it is necessary for us!). Do we currently set aside our pursuit of spiritual things and a right relationship with Him for more selfish pursuits? Do we routinely set aside assembling with the saints to commemorate His death, worship, and learn more of His will for: recreational pursuits; time with our families; choosing to work; or other non-spiritual activities? There is certainly nothing wrong with any of these, unless we  prefer  and  choose  them over spending time worshiping and commemorating Jesus with His brethren. Isn’t that what “forsaking our own assembling together” means, cf. Hebrews 10:25 ?  There are times for all of us when “missing” services is required by an ox in the ditch/well , cf. Luke 14:5 . But, it is another matter entirely to lead that ox into the ditch, or push him into the well ourselves, and then to build a fence around him so he can’t get out to provide ourselves with a continual “excuse”! And yet, isn’t that exactly what we do when we willingly commit ourselves to activities that we know will require us to forsake the assembly? “Having to” miss worship is one thing- “volunteering” or “choosing” to do so is another matter entirely. If we “choose” to play, work, or visit instead of worship, are we really any different from those who “paid no attention and went their way, one to his own farm, another to his business” instead of attending the “wedding feast for his son” offered by the king in Matthew 22:5 ? Such sure sounds like our hearts are not in the right place. So the question remains: What are you willing to leave to pursue spiritual things and a right relationship with Jesus Christ?","I grew up in the country. Dad was the Ag teacher at the country school, and we lived on ten acres a couple of miles away. But up the road, a few more miles further out, was “the farm.” It was about 100 acres where there were a few head of cattle, a couple of horses, the garden (more like a truck crop!), and plenty of work to be done building/repairing fences, cutting firewood, brush-hogging, mowing, and clearing land. When Donna and I married, we lived on the hill at the upper end overlooking the rest of the farm. It was beautiful, quiet, and idyllic. Then came the preaching....  The first couple of congregations with which I worked were country churches, so we continued to live on the farm, or in one case, rented a country home from one of the members that was much closer to the building. Then we worked with a couple of “city churches,” and had to move to town. This was somewhat of an adjustment- people actually walked through our yard on a sidewalk, which was a new experience, but we adjusted. However, when the opportunity arose to move back to East Texas, we wanted a place of our own to finish raising our boys.  So, through the local brethren’s generosity, we were able to look for a home of our own- the first one since we left “the farm” some fourteen years earlier. If we were going to live “in town,” it was important to me to at least have space, so we wound up purchasing a home in an older neighborhood with a large lot- just under two acres. Although it doesn’t have a sidewalk, it does have a curb and gutter by the street. Since it is a large lot, it has a two hundred sixty-five foot curb/gutter (yes, I measured). Thus began the battle to keep the grass and dirt in the yard instead of the gutter!  The other day, I was performing what I try to limit to a “once” or “twice a year” project of shoveling the dirt out of the gutter that seems to collect there from all over the place. I hate this job. It’s hard work made more so by years spent sitting at a desk with my head in the Book. My hands have become far too accustomed to a computer keyboard, and my back to a comfy office chair, to be good at operating a shovel and wheelbarrow anymore! But there I was, covered in sweat from the cuffs of my shirtsleeves to my socks, shoveling dirt, gravel, and grass out of the gutter. When I took a break to cool off and catch my breath, I plopped down on the bank with my feet in the gutter and my head on my knees. Then it happened. A very nice lady stopped, rolled down her window, and asked, “Are you alright?” Somewhat disgusted with my lack of stamina (from eating too well and sweating too little), I replied, “No Ma’am, I need someone to finish this job for me!” Shocked, I’m sure, she said, “Oh, well, that’s not me.” Then she smiled, rolled up her window, and drove away. It was sweet of her to stop and check on me. But, this little episode got me to thinking….  In our lives as Christians, we all need someone to care enough to take the time and trouble to stop what they’re doing long enough to simply ask, “Are you OK?” If this dear lady’s care and concern invigorated and motivated me to get up and finish the task at hand, despite my disgust at my weakness and lack of endurance, how much more so is it important for us to do the same for one another in the “race that is set before us” as Christians? Whether it is through infirmity, weakness, or just generally being “out of spiritual shape,” we all get tired and discouraged at times. Someone being concerned enough to just ask, “Are you OK?” can be a real boost. It can motivate us to get up, get busy, and finish the job!  It is so very easy to become so involved with “our own little” world of tasks and troubles, that we fail to take the time to notice someone else that might need just to know we care. She didn’t have to get out of her vehicle, take the shovel, and finish loading the wheelbarrow for me. She just cared enough to stop and express concern. “And we urge you, brethren… encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with all men… always seek after that which is good for one another and for all men,”  1Thessalonians 5:14-15 . Remember the song we sometimes sing, “There is room in the kingdom of God, my brother, for the small things that you can do; just a small, kindly deed that may cheer another is the work God has planned for you.” Thank-you, Ma’am, you made my day!","The last two editions have been on “Love and Trust” as the foundation of any human relationship, and “Loving the Word” as the single most important factor in determining our eternal destiny, respectively. In this concluding article of this trio, let’s consider the essentiality of “Trusting the Word.”  What does it mean to “trust the Word”? The meaning of “trust” can be seen through some of its synonyms, like  conviction   , dependence , reliance , and  confidence  . So, are your  convictions  based on the Word of God (book, chapter, and verse), or someone else’s faith, Colossians 3:18 ? Do you  depend  on the Word of God to guide your steps in life, or on the wisdom of men, 1Corinthians 1:20 ? Do you  rely  on the Word of God in times of doubt and trouble, or on your own understanding, Proverbs 3:5 ? Is your  confidence  of an eternal reward based in the Word of God, or your own emotions, 1John 2:3-6 ? Now let’s ask the question again, “Do you really ‘trust the Word,’ or is that just lip service, Matthew 15:8-9 ?”  However, there is another set of applications regarding “trusting the Word” that we really need to consider. “Do we really ‘trust the Word’ enough to be willing to: base our convictions on it exclusively ; to depend on it rather than men’s wisdom in doctrine ; to rely on it in times of congregational trouble ; and to have confidence in it to attract and save men’s souls ?” Let’s consider these individually for a moment.   “Do we really ‘trust the Word’ enough to base our convictions on it exclusively ?” Or, do we tend to rely instead on the faith of our family or friends to tell us what to believe, and where to “go to church”? If we really trust the Word to be “inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work” ( 2Timothy 2:16-17 ), on what or who else do we need to base our convictions? Trust the Word, Matthew 10:37 !   “Do we really ‘trust the Word’ enough to depend on it rather than men’s wisdom in doctrine?”  If we can’t determine what we should believe, teach, and practice doctrinally without input from some man, publication of men, college, or denominational headquarters, we really don’t “trust the Word” at all. The Bible was written to be read, understood, and followed, Ephesians 3:3-5 , and through these, to provide entrance to eternal life. Therefore, my or your understanding of it shouldn’t require some sort of “clergy” or “headquarters” explanation. Surely the God who created man “of the dust” and gave him life can communicate with him in language that he can understand. Trust the Word, 1Corinthians 2:10-13 !   “Do we really ‘trust the Word’ enough to rely on it in times of congregational trouble?”  Or, do we look for help from any and every other source? Let’s be clear, “congregational troubles” almost always come from failures to trust and follow God’s Word in the first place- and can only be cleared up by reversing course and “Remember(ing) therefore from where you have fallen, and repent(ing) and do(ing) the deeds you did at the first….”  Revelation 2:5 . But all too often, when problems pop up, we want to call this preacher or that one, or resort to some other human source for advice. Instead, knees and noses are the key- get on your knees in prayer to the Father , and put you nose in His Book. Trust God and the Word, 1Peter 2:1-3 !   “Do we really ‘trust the Word’ enough to have confidence in it to attract and save men’s souls?”  Or, will we succumb to the egotistical urges of our humanity to want to “help” God by “dressing up” the gospel so it will appeal to the fickle and those otherwise uninterested in it? Will we trust its power to save, or feel the need to adorn it with food and entertainment? Will we “preach the word, ” or file off its “rough edges” to make it more appealing and palatable to the masses? Will we trust “the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified,”  Acts 20:32 ; or put our confidence in various “programs” and devices it never mentions to draw men to God and save their souls? Trust the Word, Romans 1:16 !  Love and trust are the foundations of every relationship we humans sustain. They are also the basis of our relationship with God. Do you love and trust Him enough to also love and trust His Word?","Let’s start with a confession: Last week’s article on “Love and Trust” was at least somewhat foundational and preparatory for this one (and next week’s too). We needed to be aware of the importance of love and trust to any relationship we sustain before considering this question: “What is the single most important factor in determining whether one is lost or saved?”    Obviously, “sin” is the cause for anyone being lost- but that is not exactly the point of the question. Surely everyone sins, or at least has sinned, Romans 3:23 ; and sin separates us from God both here and eternally, Isaiah 59:1-2 . But, it is also obvious that not everyone who has sinned will be eternally lost, 1Corinthians 6:9-11 . “Sin,” therefore, and perhaps somewhat surprisingly, is not the single most important factor determining whether one is lost or saved.   “Jesus Christ” must be the answer. Actually, it isn’t. Don’t get me wrong- no one can be saved without the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ, Ephesian 1:7 ! But, Jesus loved and sacrificed Himself for everyone, Romans 8:32 . However, everyone won’t be saved, Matthew 7:13-14 . So, neither is He the real determining factor between salvation and condemnation.  Then surely the answer must be, “Truth!” The word of God must be the most important factor in determining whether one is lost or saved. After all, “The truth shall set you free!” Actually, quoting only half of John 8:32 has given many folks a false impression. Jesus’ whole sentence is, “ If you abide in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine; and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” So then, the truth itself doesn’t set anyone “free” apart from his or her knowledge of and obedience to it. The truth cannot be the determining factor because the gospel is given “to every one,”  Romans 1:16 , but not everyone will be saved by it, cf. John 12:48 .  And while we’re at it, no “church” is the determining factor as to whether one is saved or lost either. Of course it’s true that churches either teach Truth by “handling accurately the word of truth,”  2Timothy 2:15 ; or, they espouse as “their doctrines the precepts of men,”  Matthew 15:9 . But this, of itself does not determine whether or not anyone is saved or lost. Churches, through their faithful or unfaithful teaching, may well influence whether souls are saved or lost, but are not the single most important determining factor.  So, if it is not sin, Jesus Christ, Truth, or even a/the church, what is the single most important factor in determining whether one is saved or lost? Note carefully the specific reason 2Thessalonians 2:10 provides as to why “those who perish” will be lost: “because they did not receive the love of truth so as to be saved.” Please understand why this is the answer to our question. “Sin” condemns everyone because all sin,  Romans 5:12 ; but we don’t have to live in sin, or even with its consequences, vv.21 – 6:23 . Through “Jesus Christ,” God’s grace providesthe instructions for all men to be saved, Titus 2:11-14 ; but instructions only benefit those who follow them. “Truth” indeed saves, but only when it is known and obeyed,  John 8:31-32 . The “church” doesn’t save anyone; it is the product/result of people being saved, Acts 2:41,47 . But, we overcome sin through Jesus Christ when we know and obey the Truth and are thus added to the church (the body of the saved). What is at the beginning of this string? What determines whether or not we progress all the way to salvation? Listen again to Paul’s words to the Thessalonians regarding those who perish: “because they did not receive the love of truth so as to be saved.”   As we indicated last week, any human relationship must have love and trust at its foundation. We cannot build a relationship with God without these same elements. But how do we manifest love and trust to God, and have confidence in our relationship with Him? “And by this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments,”  1John 2:3 . It is not enough to just say we love God, Matthew 7:21 ; we must  love His word enough to obey it. Failing to love the truth so as to be saved” is the single most important factor in determining our salvation, or condemnation. Do you love truth enough read it, study it, and understand and obey it? Or, are you just giving “lip service” to your love for God and His word? Think carefully- y our  soul hangs in the balance.","Love and trust are the basis of all deep and personal relationships we humans sustain. Whether in marriage, family, or just the kind of friendship that is as close as family, love and trust are the foundational components of the relationship. If love “makes the world go ‘round,” then trust allows us the security of being able to depend on its sustained revolutions. Obviously then, trust is just as vital as love to every significant relationship we sustain- perhaps even more so. Think about it….  Many people marry for “love,” and hope trust develops in the relationship. That’s backwards for a simple reason: You can decide and commit to loving someone whether they reciprocate it or not; but, trust demands their involvement in that they have to be trustworthy for you to believe and hope in them. Trust should, therefore, precede even love in the development of a relationship, because it is more dependent on the other person. Put in other words: You can decide to and learn to love someone whom you trust, but you cannot decide and learn to trust someone who is untrustworthy just because you love him/her- at least not without detrimental consequences. As a society, if we would consider marrying people we trust, and then choose and decide to love them, it would work out a lot better than trying to trust people just because we love them. But, the importance of trust and love in relationships is not limited to marriage. Trying to be close personal friends with someone you can’t or don’t trust likewise has disastrous consequences attached. And certainly, there are innumerable family relationships that are ruined because lies have destroyed the ability to trust, though love is still abundantly present. All of which proves that although love may indeed “make the world go ‘round,” trust has to be the axis on which it hangs and spins!  Now, all of that was somewhat of a foundational introduction to get to this: “Any close and personal relationship we hope to sustain with God must be founded and operated on the same basis of trust and love.” Though God certainly loved us when we were untrustworthy and unlovable,  cf. Romans 5:8 , our efforts to have a relationship with Him are founded in His eminent trustworthiness and magnanimous love for us. However, if God loved us but was not worthy of our trust, He wouldn’t be a good God, and we couldn’t depend on Him. Thankfully, such is not the case. Titus 1:2 and Hebrews 6:18 tells us that God “cannot lie,” and that in fact, it is “impossible” for Him to do so. Not only is it impossible for God to lie to us, He is utterly dependable with regard to every aspect of His love and provision for us- He wants and does nothing but what is best for us. He has given us “all things that pertain to life and godliness” to enable us to escape “the corruption that is in the world,”  2Peter 1:3- 4. He disciplines us “for our good, that we may share His holiness,”  Hebrews 12:10 . And, He even provides for our physical needs and wants by doing “good” and giving us “rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness,”  Acts 14:17 . All of which is lasting testimony to not only His love for us, but also to His complete trustworthiness!   But alas, relationships have two sides. What about our part of this “personal relationship” with God that is supposed to characterize our Christianity? Just saying that we “love God” isn’t any more sufficient grounds for this relationship than it was for any of the others we’ve considered. There has to be trust here also for a sustainable and pleasing relationship to exist. So, the big question becomes: “Can God trust y ou ?” Do you lie to God? Are you dependable and worthy of His trust? Certainly, none of us can hope to reciprocate God’s love and trustworthiness in equal measure- and I’m not even remotely suggesting such. But, the truth remains that if we desire a “close and personal relationship” with God, we must give diligence to fulfilling, as best we can, our responsibilities to the foundations of such a bond. This means we must not only love, but endeavor to be lovable- “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him, and make Our abode with him,”  John 15:23 . It also means that we must not only trust, but strive to be trustworthy- “be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life,”  Revelation 2:10 (KJV). Think about these things, and please make whatever changes are needed in your relationship with God. He’s already doing His part!","The word “soldier” does not occur in Paul’s letter to the Ephesians (in the NASV), but a good portion of chapter six is filled with the imagery of  armor  and  warfare   . He writes of: “the full armor of God,  vv.11,13 ; “our struggle ” (or “wrestle” in some versions- to fight ), v.12 ; “ loins girded with truth ,”  v.14a ; “the breastplate of righteousness ,”  v.14b ; feet “ shod with the preparation of the gospel ,”  v.15 ;and “the shield of faith ,”  v.16 . And then, of course, there is “the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God ” in v.17 . So even though the word “soldier” is not present, there is no doubt that being a Christian is supposed to involve us in warfare- a fight against the “schemes of the devil,”  v.11 , and “world forces of darkness” and “spiritual forces of wickedness,”  v.12 ! But does it always? The answer depends on the individual soldier! For instance…   Are you  “4F”? This is the military designation given to those “not qualified for service in the Armed forces” because of “physical, mental, or moral” unfitness. Though physical fitness is not nearly as important in the Lord’s army as in Uncle Sam’s,  mental  and  moral  fitness are vital to the soldier of Christ! Intimate knowledge of the weapon itself, and its capabilities and limitations, is crucial to the proper use of the “sword of the Spirit, which the word of God”!  Hebrews 5:12 highlights the importance of good training with the sword in preparation of its proper use, “For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for some one to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God….”. Thus,  mental  fitness is important for the soldier of Christ- but, so too,  moral  fitness is required. Note 2Timothy 2:21 in this regard, “Therefore, if a man cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.” The “things” from which Paul urges us to cleanse ourselves are further clarified in the context as “wrangling about words,” “worldly and empty chatter,” “ungodliness,” “wickedness,” and “youthful lusts,”  vv.14,16,19,22 . Given these things, are you “4F,” or physically, mentally, and morally fit for service in the Lord’s army?   Are you  “AWOL”? This is the military designation for those who are “absent without leave.” It means they left their post and/or duties without permission to do so. This is a problem in the Lord’s army too! On a local level, the church is plagued by AWOL members who think nothing of absenting themselves for weeks at a time from the assembly, and its fellowship and duties, without a word to anyone. If questioned about it, they sometimes bristle and become indignant at the question, or pass it off with something along the lines of, “Oh, we’ve been really busy lately.” Can you image an infantryman explaining his being AWOL that way? No one is suggesting that local church members need some sort of advanced “permission” to be out of town for business or pleasure. But at the same time, shouldn’t members feel some sense of obligation to their local church families? What happens to our responsibilities to assemble with one another for worship, and to teach, admonish, and encourage one another when we choose to be AWOL for weeks at a time? Do we expect God and our brethren to just “suspend” our responsibilities because we prefer to be somewhere else doing something else? Please consider 1Corinthians 11:18-34 ; Ephesians 5:18-21 ; and Hebrews 10:19-25 in these regards.   Are you  “MIA”? This is the military designation for those who are “missing in action.” I suppose the correlation this case would be comparable to church member being away from his own “regiment” (local fellowship), but still working for the Cause. That is, he may not be with his own congregation, but he is assembling with and encouraging others wherever he is to be “strong in the faith.” Is this the attitude you have when away from home- to find brethren that you can help to strengthen and encourage with your presence and participation? Or, is it more along the lines of, “I’ll go somewhere for worship if it’s not too far and I’m not too busy or tired.”? The first one is MIA- the second is probably just AWOL!   Are you a  “POW”? This is the military designation for those who are “prisoners of war.” Unfortunately, in physical and spiritual wars, there are captives. There are some who, despite their efforts to “fight the enemy,” fall prey to them and become POWs. They become entangled in the defilements of the world and the affairs of this life and are overcome,  cf. 2Timothy 2:4 ; 2Peter 2:20 . In short, they are overrun by sin, Hebrews 12:2 , or caught/captured by trespasses,  Galatians 6:1 . Is this you? Are you a POW? If so, you’re supposed to have fellow soldiers out diligently searching for and rescuing you, Galatians 6:1ff ; Hebrews 12:12,13,15 !  What about it? Are you 4F, AWOL, MIA, or a POW ? Or, are you still a “hard-fighting soldier” in the Lord’s army?","Some folks say that repentance is “the hardest command of God to obey.” Perhaps this is so, but why? The answer is actually pretty simple: Repentance requires us to change our minds, hearts, and lives. Not so easy? I said the answer was simple - I didn’t say it was easy!  Let’s begin with a clear picture of exactly what repentance is, and isn’t. Repentance is, as implied above, a change of mind and heart that leads to a change of course or direction. More graphically, it is deciding that you are going the wrong direction in life, making a U-turn, and then being happy about the change. Take these elements one at a time for a little more clarification.   The Decision. For anyone to truly repent, a change of mind has to take place. A bank robber may stop robbing for a while because he fears the police are on to him. He hasn’t repented though he has changed his behavior. There was no change of mind regarding the sinfulness of his activity, nor was there a change of heart (emotions or desires) either, just a fear of being caught. So, his behavioral change isn’t true repentance, it’s just a temporary modification that will inevitably revert back to its former state.   The Change. True repentance also requires a change of activity, course, or direction in life. To borrow from the same illustration of our bank robber, imagine that he reaches the conclusion that what he has been doing is just not right. He’s taking by force what belongs to others, and breaking both God’s and man’s laws by so doing. But, because he’s also unwilling to “work for a living,” he continues to rob banks anyway. He’s changed his mind regarding the rightness/wrongness of his activity, but has not changed his behavior. This can’t be repentance either- the end result of his life is exactly as it was; he just has a guilty conscience about it now!   The Emotion. Let’s go back our bank robber one last time. He changes his mind about the course of his life, and as a result, stops robbing banks and gets a job (as a security expert for the banking industry!). But, though he changed his mind and life, he isn’t happy about it. In fact, he’s miserable and misses the “excitement” of his former life, as well as the luxuries it provided him. Has he repented? He isn’t robbing banks anymore, and doesn’t intend to do so again, but he sure longs for his previous path. He’s doing the rightthings in his life, and even thinking and saying the rightthings in his job, but he doesn’t feel the right things! How long do you suppose he’ll stick to the “strait and narrow” way?  Do you see now why repentance requires a change of mind, activity, and emotion ? Just modifying one of the three requirements doesn’t result in lasting change. Again, the reason is simple: In modifying one part of himself, he failed to change all of himself. Repentance, to be effective, must change everything about us- our minds (decision-making processes), our activities (the overall course and direction of our lives), and our hearts (how we feel about this new direction relative to our past). Now, lest you think I’m pulling all of this out of my hat, note what the Bible says on the subject.    Matthew 3:8-9  . Hypocritical Jewish leaders came with the multitudes of believers to be baptized by John. These leaders were doing the right thing, but their minds were not right in this matter. Therefore, John told them they needed to “bring forth fruits in keeping with your repentance.” How does this indicate their repentance was incomplete in regard to their thinking? Consider the next verse, “and do not suppose that…. ‘We have Abraham for our father,’ for….” Their supposition- their thinking, was wrong. Just being baptized wasn’t going to change their minds- but their minds would surely have to be changed for them to truly repent!    Acts 2:37-38  . Those who had crucified Jesus as an imposter, once they became convinced that He was indeed the Christ, asked, “Brethren, what shall we do?” Their mindshad already been changed by the apostles’ sermon, but what remained? They needed to change their course and direction in life- they needed to go from being persecutors of Christ to being His disciples. So, they were told to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ!     2Corinthians 7:10  . Paul wrote, “the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation; but the sorrow of the world produces death.” When the mind and life have been changed, the heart must follow for true repentance to occur, for Jesus said, “for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also,”  Matthew 6:21 .  Now, have you truly repented by changing your mind , your course , and your desires ? Or, are you still fighting the battle with sin by attempting to change only part of yourself? Such is surely a losing battle!","Washing the windows is a job no one really likes- unless you own a professional glass cleaning business, and are well paid to do it! But for most of us, window washing is a “have to” rather than a “want to” task. There are, however, some viable reasons for our less-than-enthusiastic attitude toward the job....  For one thing, window washing is a lot of trouble. It’s not usually just spraying some ammonia on the glass and wiping it off with a paper towel, which is why we don’t mind cleaning mirrors nearly as much as washing windows! Instead, it involves: removing all the screens; chipping off the dirt-dauber balls of concrete they manage to cement to the window frames despite the screens; dragging out the tangled, “Gordian knot” mess otherwise known as a water hose; fetching or borrowing a ladder, because you can never reach the top of the window without it; finding that handy-dandy soap-dispensing squeegee/brush combo apparatus that worked so well on that late night TV commercial (and cleaning the dirt-dauber nest out of its inlet too); and spending the better part of the day trying to figure out how to keep the soapy water from bouncing back off the window corners into your eyes. Then, there is also the troubling task of trying to figure out which screen went on which window, and constantly telling yourself, “I know it came off of one of these windows!” All of which is endured only to go back inside the house and discover streaks on every window! Then, and only then, your wife/husband hands you the phone number of a professional windowing cleaning service (insert exhausted, heavy sigh here).  It occurs to me that cleaning our windows is somewhat like cleaning our lives, in that:   Nobody really likes to do it, but it has to be done, or we suffer the consequences of a dirty and restricted view of things- not to mention the eternal consequences;  None of the “gadgets” really work- or even make the job any easier, and can make it even more difficult;  The actual tools required are simple and readily available, it’s the work that is hard;  The more often you do it, the less dirt there is to clean, and the easier the job becomes; and,  No matter how diligent you are in your cleaning, there are still going to be a few streaks and spots that you missed.   Now, these things aren’t written to depress you, or to discourage you from the task of cleaning your life, for such is surely God’s will! “Therefore, if a man cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful for the Master, prepared for every good work,”  2Timothy 2:21 . Instead, it is hoped that these simple comparisons between washing windows and cleaning your life manifest:   1) The importance of the task. It is, after all, a command of God, “Therefore, having these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God,”  2Corinthians 7:1 . Therefore, failing to “wash” ( Acts 22:16 ; 1Corinthians 6:11 ) and “cleanse” ( James 4:8 ) our lives leaves us dirty and unfit for God’s company either now, or eternally.   2) The benefit of regular effort. Your eyes are said to be the windows of your soul. Having windows that are “clean” changes your whole perspective of life. Unfortunately, the inverse is also true, just as Jesus said in Matthew 6:23 , “But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!” And finally,   3) The necessity of God’s grace. No one has the power to completely cleanse his life- Jesus has to do that by the gracious gift of His blood, Ephesians 1:7 . “If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness,”  1John 1:8-9 .  The point is simple: Just like washing windows, cleaning your life requires some diligence, but the view afterwards is well worth the effort!","Most people don’t want to be considered “unreasonable.” In fact, some will even compromise or abandon the principles upon which they base their reason just because someone else accuses them of being unreasonable. Do we really understand what it means to be “reasonable” in the first place?  Generally, being “reasonable” means to think, and therefore act, in a rational way. One who has used his intellect to come to a logical conclusion, and then acts accordingly, is usually thought to be “reasonable.” This means the inverse is also true: one who fails to use rational thought processes, and then acts accordingly, is being “unreasonable”- and usually suffers for it!  There are at least a couple of important aspects of these things that we need to consider. “Reasonable” actions come from reason- not impulse. When we react impulsively to a situation without taking the time to “think it through,” we typically wind up acting unreasonably. We are then allowing the quicker but shallower aspects of our desires to cut off opportunity for slower but deeper deliberate thought by acting immediately. Sometimes, we even admit as much by saying, “I’m going to go ahead and do this now before I have time to think about it.” But conversely, God wants us to take the time to allow our intellect to override our impulsive desires before we act or react, for such is the “reasonable” course. For instance, the Lord’s brother wrote that we should be “quick to hear” but “slow to speak and slow to anger,”  James 1:1 . If we stop long enough to really listen and think, we can keep our emotions in check, and perhaps keep our feet out of our mouths also!  Now that we have the principle down, let’s make a few applications of using rational thoughts to produce reasonable decisions and actions (these are largely unrelated otherwise).  Is it reasonable to conclude that the intellect, order, and intricacy of the world just happened accidently by chance, or is that just what we want to believe? The simple principle of Cause and Effect is highlighted in Hebrews 3:4 this way, “For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.” No one “reasonably” looks at a house and concludes that it is the result of a mindless accident of chance- that some existent materials exploded and a house resulted. And yet, many seem to desire to believe that such is the origin of our world and life on it. Surely it is more “reasonable” to believe that the eternal intellect and power of God created the life and order of all things.  Is it reasonable to continually violate one’s own conscience, or do we allow our impulses and desires to override and suppress our thought processes? The very idea of “violating one’s conscience” necessarily implies an admission that what we are doing is “wrong” rather than “right”- at least as far as we understand them. So, why do we continually do that which contradicts our own understanding and thought processes? Surely such is “unreasonable” behavior! Note 1John 3:21-22 in this regard, “Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; and whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight.”   Is it reasonable to expect God to judge us on the basis of our emotional attachment to Him alone, or is that just what we want to believe? There is no doubt or argument that God desires and expects us to love Him, but is it reasonable to conclude that this is all that He expects? Was that all He did for us- just love us? Or, did He also act in our best interest? He not only loved us, He provided a way to save us through Jesus Christ, cf. Roman 5:8 ; John 3:16 . But is it reasonable to conclude that all we have to do is love Him in order to be saved eternally? What did Jesus say? Note His words on this point in John 14:15 , “If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.” And also, John 14:23 , “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him…”   In 2Thessalonians 3:2 , Paul asked the Thessalonians to pray that he and those with him might “be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men, (KJV). Perhaps we should also pray that we might  be  reasonable  rather than  unreasonable men. I do!","Historically, God has often used water to test would-be followers to see if their faith was sufficient to produce obedience, and therefore become saving faith,  cf. James 2:17,20,24,26 . Please note a few examples:  · Genesis 6-9 . Noah needed sufficient faith to build and stock an ark to save himself, his family, and sufficient representative animals to repopulate the earth after the flood. Among all the other amazing facets regarding this story is the fact that Noah had never even seen rain, cp. Genesis 2:5-6 ; Hebrews 11:7 . Nonetheless, by faith he built and stocked an ark for a water event he had never seen or experienced!  · Exodus 14:21-22 . After the Israelites had been freed from their Egyptian bondage by God, they journeyed southward toward Mt. Sinai. Before long, they came to a formidable obstacle- the Red Sea. To make matters worse, by this time Pharaoh had changed his mind about their release and pursued them with his army. They were trapped- Pharaoh behind them, and the Red Sea in front of them. Then God tested their faith (with water), and told them to go forward! So, as commanded, Moses stretched out his staff over the water, and God “swept the sea back with a strong east wind all night, and turned the sea into dry land, so the waters were divided. And the sons of Israel went through the midst of the sea on dry land, and the waters were like a wall to them on their right hand and on their left,”  Exodus 14:21-22 . Have you thought about the faith it required to take your family and all you possessed and walk through the midst of a sea with a wall of water on both sides? Remember, these walls of water, once released by God after the Israelites had safely passed, were sufficient to drown the whole Egyptian army, Exodus 14:26-31 !  · Numbers 20:8 . As the children of Israel journeyed through the wilderness toward the promised land of Canaan, the record says “there was no water for the congregation,”  v.2 . They complained to Moses and he entreated God for assistance. The Lord replied, “Take the rod; and you and your brother Aaron assemble the congregation and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it may yield its water.” Since the congregation had already begun a mutiny against him, how much faith did it take for Moses to stand before the whole lot of them and speak to a rock that it might provide water? How silly that must have looked! But because of Moses’ faithful obedience to His instructions, God provided the life-saving water.  · Joshua 3:14-17 . When the Israelites finally reached Canaan, there was yet another significant obstacle impeding their way- the Jordan River. Most of the year, the Jordan was a peaceful stream that, in most places, could be easily waded. But it was then at flood stage near Jericho, and was thus impossible to safely cross- especially for two and a half million people carrying all of their possessions! In fact, the Canaanite cities along its western side were depending upon the flooded Jordan to protect them from the invading Israelites. But note God’s instructions to the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant, “When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan,”  v.8 . He also commanded that all the congregation of Israel should go with the Ark, but at a distance of 3,000 feet so all the people could see it. As the priests entered the floodwaters with the Ark, they faithfully obeyed God by standing still. The raging waters “stood and rose up in a heap” upstream, and the people again crossed a great body of water on dry land, vv.16-17 . When the people finished, the priests carrying the ark also crossed over toward Jericho, and the waters of the river returned to the previous flooded state! Think about it: God required faith sufficient to act in obedience by walking into the water before He stopped its flow.  In these four Old Testament examples, we see how God tested people’s faith to see if they were worthy of salvation. Would they believe enough to obey Him by building an ark in preparation for something they had never seen; or walk into a dry sea bed with two giant walls of water on each side miraculously held in place by God; or speak to a rock in the middle of the desert to obtain life-giving water; or walk into a raging torrent trusting God to stop it? All of these “tests” included two elements: faith and water . Is it any wonder that Jesus required the same for salvation in His name? “He that believes and is baptized will be saved,” ( Mark 16:16 , ESV).","Dr. Stephen R. Covey, famed author of and lecturer on “The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,” said, “You cannot talk yourself out of problems you behave yourself into.” (Emphasis added, PCS). While I believe Dr. Covey was entirely correct in the “bigger picture view” of personal accountability and growth, the truth of his statement sure doesn’t seem to alter the modus operandi for a lot of us! Attempting to “talk our way out of problems” is the standard operating procedure for a world of people who believe saying “I’m sorry” will fix anything and everything. This view is somewhat infantile and very naïve. Proffering an apology and/or a list of excuses meant to either justify our actions, or negate culpability for them, simply does not correct behavioral issues. What we say may mitigate some consequences of our actions in a few cases, but does nothing to correct the underlying problem. While the acknowledgment of responsibility coupled with a sincere apology is absolutely the right starting point, the real solution is changed behavior- not an endless stream of apologies and excuses.  There are a few examples that will well illustrate the principle that we cannot talk ourselves out of problems that have a behavioral cause.   Broken Promises in Relationships- We can apologize and attempt to justify or excuse ourselves all we want, but our relationships with friends, children, or even co-workers, bosses, or employees are often irreparably damaged when we fail, or repeatedly fail, to keep our word.   Broken Trust in Marriage- One of the most heart-rending questions I have been asked had to do with how to rebuild trust in a marriage once it had been broken by infidelity. Even the truly penitent, who want nothing more than to “go back” to where they were in their marriage before the offence, have to understand that trust cannot be rebuilt with mere words of promise or apology- it takes patient and consistent trustworthy actions.   Broken Fellowship with Brethren- While godly brethren are usually eager to forgive and reinstate into fellowship an erring brother or sister who sincerely confesses fault and seeks forgiveness- and rightfully so, the worthiness of that clemency is necessarily proven over time by his continued fruits (actions) of repentance.  But aside from these relational issues, the most important application of the principle that we cannot  talk  our way out of problems our  behavior  has caused concerns our salvation- our relationship with God that has been severed by sin ( cf. Isaiah 55:8-9 ). John the Baptist didn’t tell wayward Jews what to  say  to return to favor with God, he told them what they needed to  do   - “Therefore bring forth fruits in keeping with your repentance; and do not say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father,’”  Matthew 3:8-9 . On the day of Pentecost, those convicted of having killed the Messiah didn’t ask what to  say  , but what to  do  to be forgiven of their guilt of sin. They asked, “Brethren, what shall we do?” in Acts 2:37 , and were told to, “Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus for the forgiveness of your sins…” in v.38 . Saul of Tarsus, that feared persecutor of the early church, when he became aware that he was fighting against rather than for God, was not told what to say, but what to do. He had spent three days saying prayersthrough which heundoubtedly sought guidance and forgiveness, but when the Lord’s prophet Ananias came, he simply told him what he needed to  do  - “And now why do you delay? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord,”  Acts 22:16 .  None of these examples are given to minimize the importance of confessing sin, or saying, “I’m sorry for my sin”- either to others, or to God. These are certainly good and proper initial steps. But they are provided to further emphasize the point that problems or situations caused by  behavior  (in this case, “sin”) have solutions that involve more than just talk - they require action. Biblical, saving faith is not accomplished with words, but actions,  James 2:14-17 . True understanding and wisdom is not demonstrated by what we say, but what we do,  James 3:13 . And “pure and undefiled religion” is not the result of our words, but the practice of God’s Word, James 1:26-27 ! Now, are you trying to  talk  your way out of the rightful consequences of your behavior, or are you willing rebuild proper relationships with God and others by consistently and faithfully  doing  the right things?","I don’t like Humpty-Dumpty. There are a number of reasons for this: 1) I have no idea who or what a “Humpty-Dumpty” was, or was supposed to be; 2) I don’t know why he was sitting on the wall in the first place; 3) I don’t know what caused his great fall; and, 4) I don’t how the king’s horses were supposed to put him together again, or why the king’s men couldn’t do so. But I have suspicions about that last part….  I suspect that the king’s horses couldn’t put Humpty together again because hooves are not conducive to such things, but also that his men couldn’t do so because they couldn’t find all the pieces! After all, have you ever tried to put some broken thing back together without having all the pieces with which to work? And yet, such is usually what we ask God to do with our broken lives!   There is a song in our hymnal that I really like, and would like you to consider. The first verse reads, “Bring Christ your broken life, so marred by sin, He will create anew, make whole again; your empty wasted years He will restore, and your iniquities remember no more.” The second verse continues with, “Bring Him your every care if great or small- whatever troubles you- O bring it all! Bring Him the haunting fears, the nameless dread, thy heart He will relieve, and lift up thy head.” (“Bring Christ Your Broken Life” by T.O. Chisholm; Hymns for Worship ; #322). What a wonderful sentiment and promise! What encouragement this song brings to the broken-hearted and downtrodden! But, there are a couple of caveats that should also be realized.   Christ promises to “make whole again” our spiritual lives, but not necessarily our physical ones. I fear that, all too often, we would prefer Christ to solve the physical problems of our lives more than we’d like Him to “fix” our spiritual issue of the guilt of sin. Think about it this way: When you pray, is your prayer dominated by physical or spiritual concerns? It is certainly proper to beseech the Father regarding matters that are purely physical in nature (see Matthew 6:11 ), but didn’t Jesus teach in Matthew 6:25-33 that these are to be at least secondary concerns to spiritual matters? More than preferring “to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord” ( 2Corinthians 5:8 ), we seem to want God to make our earthly sojourn “heaven on earth.” This He did not promise to do, and such is surely “walking by sight” rather than “walking by faith,”  2Corinthians 5:7 .  But even more to the point of our title, Christ cannot- or perhaps better will not, “make whole again” our spiritual lives if we only give Him some of the pieces. Even the song mentioned above emphasizes this point with the line, “O bring it all!” We typically want God “to put our lives or selves back together again” without giving Him all of the pieces. We withhold portions of our hearts, our minds, our bodies, or even our spirits. It is grossly unfair to expect God to “make whole again” our lives that we’ve broken by sin without giving Him “all” of us. All the king’s horses and men couldn’t put Humpty back together again without his head (mind), heart (emotions/desires), body (strength), and spirit (soul), and neither will God, even if He can do so, cf. Mark 12:30 .  So, in coming to Christ and desiring to have Him put the broken pieces of your life back together again, consider two questions. Firstly, do you really only desire the physical aspects of your life (financial, family, health, etc.) to be what you want them to be, or are you truly more concerned with your spiritual health and well-being? And secondly, are you willing to give Christ “all” of you- heart, mind, body, and soul that He might make them whole again, or, are you hiding or withholding pieces and parts but still expecting the same result?  God is obviously much better at “putting the pieces” of our Humpty-Dumpty broken lives back together again than all the king’s horses and men were, but we have to give Him all the pieces!","Have you ever been in such a painful predicament that death seemed like the only hope of relief? Elijah once expressed a similar sentiment in 1Kings 19:4 , “It is enough; now, O Lord, take my life….”. The prophet came to this point of utter exasperation for reasons he proffered in v.10 , “the sons of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, torn down Thine altars and killed Thy prophets with the sword. And I alone am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.” Elijah viewed his situation as hopeless, and apparently preferred that the Lord take his life instead of his enemies doing so. But, as is the case with most things we humans see as hopeless, he was wrong. The Lord tells him that it is not nearly as bad as he thinks- that are yet 7,000 in Israel who do not worship the idol Baal ( v.17 ), and also gives him a set of instructions telling to him to basically get up and get busy ( vv.15-17 ). There are apparent lessons for all of us in this story, but let’s get back to our original question, “Have you ever been in such a painful predicament that death seemed like the only hope of relief?”  I’ve been close to this situation- close enough that I was actually OK with dying “today ” if such was the Lord’s will. Obviously, it is not a pleasant place to be physically, but it is spiritually liberating. Once you reach the point of actually relinquishing the stranglehold we try to maintain on physical life, and trust God completely with your physical and spiritual existence, you become free not only from the constraints of “life” that death holds over you, but you are also released from the shackles of sin to which the fear of death holds the key ( cf. Hebrews 2:15 and Romans 8:15 ).  I’m not at all suggesting that salvation is achieved through such a mental and spiritual epiphany alone- just that it is realized in a way that perhaps did not fully dawn on us at the initial point of our surrender to belief in Christ and our rebirth in Him through baptism. In this regard at least, it seems suppose matures and comes to full fruition as does our faith and trust- at the sunset of life, or at we at least perceive to be our end. It is then that “salvation” becomes a matter of complete faith and trust in God in a way that it has never been previously.  But for salvation, or even this more complete realization of it, to mature into complete faith and trust, it must have a birth- a beginning. Often this point of origin takes root in utter despair and the recognition of our complete dependence upon God. The prodigal son of Luke 15 did not “come to his senses” until his wallowing in the muck and mire of immorality had exhausted all his resources and completely enslaved him. Such is the nature of sin. It incarcerates us in our own selfish desires. Emancipation from this enslavement to sin involves execution. In fact, execution is the only exit to spiritual incarceration. Let me explain with the help of Romans 6 .  Paul wrote that when we use our bodies (and lives) for selfish and sinful purposes, we become “slaves to impurity and lawlessness, resulting in further lawlessness,”  v.19 . This pervasive nature of sin entangles us to the point that we thus become “slaves to sin,”  v.20 . From this incarceration we cannot free ourselves, but there are things we must do to allow God to extricate us. Note some earlier verses in chapter six which outline them. We must become dead to sin,  v.2 . How? We die to sin by being “baptized into Christ Jesus” and being thus “baptized into His death,”  v.3 ; but this death is not just Christ’s- it must necessarily be ours also. Note carefully vv.6-7 , “knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, that our body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin; for he who died is freed from sin.” Through baptism, we die with and are buried with Christ so that we might be freed from sin. We are emancipated from spiritual incarceration through execution- the crucifixion of our selfishly sinful selves that we might be resurrected to a new and free life in Jesus!  Physical death can be a relief from suffering, but only if the soul has already been freed from its imprisonment in sin through the execution (by crucifixion) of our old self of sin. Now, are you ready to die physically “today” because you have put to death your man of sin? Or, are you still clinging helplessly and hopelessly to physical life because it is all that you have?","Please bear with me through a few more technical matters to get to some practical points. Salvation results from the combination of God’s grace and man’s faith- “For by grace you have been saved through faith,”  Ephesians 2:8 . God’s wondrous grace meets man’s faith to allow the guilt of sin to be removed so that man can be in fellowship with divinity. We do not have the right to legislate for God by attempting to apply His grace (and salvation by it) where He hasn’t promised to do so in His Word- that’s “whittling on His end of the stick” as the old timers would say. Instead, we must trust in His word to show us where He will, and won’t, apply grace to produce salvation. Thus, we shouldn’t attempt to apply God’s grace where He hasn’t specified, nor refuse to apply it where He has said that He will do so. It’s just not within our prerogative to do so.  However, faith is on our “end of the stick,” so to speak. To change the illustration, “grace” is on God’s side of the ledger, and “faith” is on man’s side. But since it is, after all, God’s ledger, salvation only occurs when God’s grace and man’s faith are properly combined. As God gets to determine the parameters of His grace, He also gets to define how faith is produced and when it is sufficient for the application of grace to result in salvation. This may sound somewhat strange if we presume that any and all “faith” is sufficient for the application of grace by God. However, this just isn’t how God designed and defined faith. As always, let’s look to His word for proper understanding and application.  “Faith” is often presumed to be a gift of God- that He gives us faith. In a sense such is true, but be careful. True biblical faith is defined by God as coming from “hearing the word of Christ,”  Romans 10:17 . We “hear” Christ when we read His words and the testimony of inspired men who penned the New Testament, “If any one thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I (Paul) write are the Lord’s commandment,”  1Corinthians 14:37 . But go back to the context of Romans 10 and realize that saving faith: is dependent on the word,  v.8 ; necessarily precedes confession and produces righteousness,  v.9-10 ; is inseparably tied to Scripture,  v.11 ; is the basis for all men to call on the Lord, vv.12-13 ; is predicated on hearing the preached (or proclaimed ) word, vv.14-15 ; and is only achieved when the word is heeded (obeyed), v.16 . Friends, this is how God defines “faith” that saves! Thiskind of faith meets the conditions God has specified for man that divine grace can then be applied to produce salvation. Anything less fails to meet God’s standards and criterion. The demons believe, or have faith that Jesus is God’s Son ( cf. James 2:19 ; Matthew 8:29 ), but are obviously not willing to allow His word to define their character and conduct in order to be saved.  What we’re hopefully seeing here is that faith is indeed given by God, but is provided through His provision of the source, or seed, of it- His word, 1Peter 1:22-23 ; Luke 8:11 . God doesn’t give us full-grown saving faith, He gives us the seed that we must accept into the fertile soil of a honest and good heart, and nurture and feed until it grows into an obedient faith that is willing to accept and do what He says is “right” that His grace might then be applied, John 3:36 ; Titus 2:11-15 .  Now, here is the promised practical portion. As saving faith is necessarily tied to hearing and obeying the word of God (as we saw from Romans 10 ), so too any “faith” we have that a practice is right or wrong must also be tied to the word of God. We can’t have “faith” that God will accept a practice, activity, or lifestyle unless His word says so. We cannot rely on our own emotions or desires in these matters regardless of whom or what practice is involved. Any such determinations must be based in a “thus sayeth the Lord” if they are to be “of faith.” We simply do not have the right to legislate for God, or the application of His grace, in these ways. So, we can’t decide to “accept” or condone practices He has condemned and still claim to be operating “by faith.” Our nation is being led to “call evil good, and good evil” ( Isaiah 5:20 ) because our people have forgotten these principles, or are being taught differently from our pulpits. If we are to be right with God, we must first be right with His word. Anything less is not, and cannot be, “of faith.”","Before you think I’ve finally flipped my lid completely, and realizing that I am far too old with knees that have had way too much sports in the past to sit cross-legged on the floor chanting anything, such is not the kind of meditation to which the title refers. Instead, the “meditation” to which I refer is simply concentrated contemplation . It doesn’t require special clothes or postures, or humming or chanting anything- but it might require practice.  Our day-to-day lives are so filled with information and entertainment that real concentrated contemplation is difficult. Oh, I know we can focus intently on a task at hand on the job, or we can even become totally engrossed with some recreational hobby or video game, but can we just sit quietly and think? Are we able to focus our attention completely on conscious contemplation for more than a few minutes? Are we able to keep our minds fixated on a particular topic of thought for an extended period- like half an hour? Or, has the constantly changing images of television led us into a short attention span epidemic? Don’t get ahead of me here. This is not an anti-television rant. I actually watch a good deal of television, and there are still worthwhile programs available. For example, a large portion of my television viewing time is devoted to watching baseball. But, have you ever noticed how many different camera switches (from differing angles) occur in the twenty or so seconds between pitches? It’s amazing to contemplate…. if you can still concentrate long enough to do so!  All of which got me to thinking about how our subconscious training toward short attention span has affected our spiritual growth and development. For me, I noticed that a few areas seemed to be the most affected. So, focus your attention as best you can, and “meditate” on them with me for a few minutes to see if you have the same challenges. After all, identifying the problem is part of the solution.   It’s hard for me to concentrate my contemplations in   prayer . My mind wanders, especially in private prayer. First, I don’t dedicate the right, or enough, time for it. I try to squeeze it in before I drift off to sleep, or before answering the next email, or even worse, before the commercial break ends! The Savior dedicated time to be in prayerful communion with His Father. He went off somewhere alone and spent hours, if not all night, pouring His heart out in divine communication. Perhaps if we would devote sufficient and appropriate time to prayer, our prayerful meditations would be better and more productive- and we’d get better at it! “Devote yourselves to prayer….”  Colossians 4:2 .   It’s hard for me to concentrate my contemplations in worship.  It is far too easy to be thinking about my sermon introduction, or adding some pertinent passage to a point in it, while we are singing praises to God. Then, my mouth sings the mostly right words- and even does so “on pitch” occasionally, and my mind is concentrating, but on the wrong thing! Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are supposed to be sung first and foremost from the heart,  Ephesians 5:19 ; Colossians 3:16 . But if I’m thinking about my sermon, or what’s for lunch, there is no true praise being given to God, there is no uplift to my spirit through singing, and there is little encouragement being given to my brethren. If such is true during the song service, how much more are the detrimental effects of this lack of concentration manifested during the memorial of Christ’s body and blood?   It’s hard for me to concentrate my contemplations on spiritual matters generally as much as I could and should. It is so easy, in our technology-based world, to have constant inputs from television, radio, computers, laptops, iPods, iPads, and iWhatever-is-the-latest techno gadget, that true quiet time alone is lost. We can fill our every waking moment with news, entertainment, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to the extent that we are never really alone and quiet. These things necessarily occupy our minds, and can effectively eliminate the possibility of meditating on spiritual matters. So, when you’re driving or mowing or doing whatever puts you alone and not having to be fully mentally occupied, try turning off the gadgets and spend some quality time concentrating your contemplations on godly things. You’ll be amazed how you’ll think of biblical passages or books you want to read ( Acts 17:11 ), or realize the spiritual needs of others that you might help ( Hebrews 10:24 ), or even discover great spiritual topics that are worthy of your meditation ( Philippians 4:8 ). Give yourself some time to tune out the world, and just be still and meditate on spiritual things. But beware- it’s addictive!","We’ve all heard it, and most of us have said it. Being thankful is always the right thing to do, but the admonition to “  Just  be thankful” is often advice given to someone who has suffered some heartbreak, disappointment, or accident. It is then that a kind soul who means well, and intends to provide a dose of needed perspective, says, “Just be thankful that…” and then adds some worse alternative which didn’t happen.  As I was driving to Tyler to haul home a broken down vehicle that had just been released from the repair shop the day before (and had both an engine and front axle rebuilt in the recent past also), my frustrations begin to mount. Self “pity party” lines rolled and wrapped through my mind. With four drivers in the family operating mostly older vehicles with high mileage, it seems we always have a vehicle (or three!) needing repair. Then it hit me: On the scale of personal difficulties and tragedies, a broken down vehicle has to be near the bottom of the problem list, if even on it at all. I was immediately both ashamed of my frustration and thankful for  my  problem(s). Others are being forced to combat diseases trying to kill their children, or struggling to understand why a loved one died far too prematurely, or trying to repair their lives after some personal tragedy- but I was despairing over a fourteen year old vehicle breaking down! So I said it, first to myself, and then out loud to family members: “Just be thankful that a broken down old car isour biggest problem!” Perspective is a wonderfully cheering and immensely liberating thing.  So, “Just be thankful” if:  · Your car is broken, because that means you have one, and it can probably be repaired, if not replaced. This is one of those problems that time or money or the combination of the two can fix. While you may not have the money now, in time, you can have it. There are a lot more serious problems that these two fixers can’t resolve- so, “Just be thankful…”  · Your parents, children, or family members are driving you crazy, because that means you still have them. I can’t imagine how difficult it must be to have lost an immediate family member prematurely and tragically- but many can because they’re still dealing with the aftermath. So, “Just be thankful…”  · Your bills are piling up, because that probably means you’ve lived sufficiently well enough to enjoy credit, and the things and activities it can buy, but for which repayment is required. And if you’re electricity bill is out of control, you can always simply have the power company remove the meter. People survived for centuries without electricity. See? Things can always be worse- so, “Just be thankful…”  · Your aches, pains, and physical difficulties seemingly require your constant attention, because that means no one has yet “thrown dirt in your face” (buried you). Our physical bodies were never meant to last forever, and will surely break down eventually. But, while there is breath, there is hope. In physical terms, this means there is “life” still be lived- do your best to make the most of and enjoy it. In spiritual terms, while there is breath means there is the opportunity to get right with God, and thus become prepared for the “life” that is to come. So, “Just be thankful…”  · You realize you’ve made a mess of your life, because that means you’ve taken the first step toward straightening things out- with God’s grace and help of course. In Luke 15 , the prodigal son’s first step toward reconciliation with his father was realizing and admitting his mistakes, “I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight,”  v.18 . We can never make a “mess” God can’t clean up, if we will realize and admit our mistakes, and return to Him in true repentance. If you’ve come to realize that you’re living in the pigsty of sin, you’ve started in the right direction and now have the opportunity to do, and be, better. So, “Just be thankful…”  Even in disappointment, heartbreak, and tragedy, there are always things for which we can, and should be, thankful. Therefore, “in everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus,”  1Thessalonians 5:18 .","What’s the line from the old Sinatra song, “Regrets I’ve had a few….”? While many have honestly said, “I have no regrets” when speaking of a specific incident or the way they handled a certain circumstance, anyone who says they have no regrets about the entirety of their lives has either lived an extremely good and conscientious life, or is an arrogant fool. I’m betting on the latter option....  The apostle Paul did indeed say that he had lived his life “in all good conscience” in Acts 23:1 , but that is not the same thing as having no regrets. One can, as Paul did, live in such a way as to never violate his conscience, Philippians 3:6 . But, the conscience, especially apart from divine revelation, is a fallible guide. You’d be hard-pressed to find a better example of this than Paul himself. Though acting “in all good conscience” prior to understanding the truth about Jesus Christ, he persecuted Him and the church, Acts 9:1ff . After coming to know Jesus as God’s Son, Paul lived the rest of his life with the pressing weight of a huge pile of regrets! Note his own words in 1Tim.1:13,15 on this point, “even though I was formerly a blasphemer and persecutor and a violent aggressor…Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost of all.”   However, Paul also epitomizes the best-case scenario of how to deal with one’s regrets. The most important key to dealing with regrets is to first stop piling them up. It is difficult indeed to effectively and productively deal with the mistakes of our past while continuing to add to the list. While we probably will add new regrets to our pile, at the very least we should stop repeating the same old ones! Isn’t that the nature and composition of spiritual growth and development? So, when Paul realized, by the revelation of truth, that Jesus was the Christ, he immediately and completely changed course. Which, by the way, is the way one is supposed to repent (see also Acts 2:36-42 for an additional example). Paul thus went from being a persecutor of Jesus and the church to being a proclaimer of Him and a preacher/producer of the church. In this way, at least, he stopped piling up regrets!  We don’t have to be a persecutor of Christ and His church to have, or continue to pile up, regrets. Jesus said, “He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me scatters,”  Matthew 12:30 . If we’re not actively with Christ, and actively working in His cause and kingdom, then we are against Him. This should certainly be a cause of regret, but the solution is simple. Start by repenting of your negligence, and then proceed by moving in the right direction. Cain, after God rejected his improper sacrifice and worship, was angry and dejected. Note God’s own words of admonition to him in Genesis 4:6-7 , “Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen? If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up?”   No matter how far you’ve gone on the wrong course, the first thing to be done is to take that initial step on the proper path! You’ll never get to where you need and want to be, spiritually speaking, unless you stop piling up additional regrets by continuing to walk away from God in sin. Long ago, God spoke to His people through the prophet Isaiah, “Behold, the Lord’s hand is not so short that it cannot save; neither is His ear so dull that it cannot hear. But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hid His face from you, so that He does not hear,”  Isaiah 59:1-2 . If you don’t feel close to God, make no mistake about who moved! God is ever accessible and able to save, if we will but come to Him in repentance by doing the right things. “Repent therefore and return, that your sins may be wiped away, in order that the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,”  Acts 3:19 .   The second vital step in dealing with regrets (after you stop adding to the pile), is to not dwell on/in them. You may never completely forget your past sins- even though God does, Hebrews 8:12 , but you can’t wallow or bury yourself in them either. Note again Paul’s example and words, “Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it (salvation, PCS) yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind  and reaching forward to what lies ahead , I press on  toward the goal ….”  Philippian 3:13-14 . Wise people have regrets, but they stop adding to the pile, and don’t bury themselves in or with it either. Be wise in dealing with your regrets.","Over the years I’ve actually enjoyed cutting brush and clearing land. It’s typically hard hot work, but everything just looks so much better after you’re done. And since three sides of our lot have a mostly bamboo border, I usually have plenty of opportunities to hone my skills! But I must confess that while I don’t really mind running the chainsaw, if the brush has to be loaded on a trailer and hauled away, well, did I mention I don’t really mind running the chainsaw? Unfortunately, although Donna is great at many things, she’s lousy at loading and hauling brush! As with most things in life, there are lessons to be learned from brush cutting/loading. I was reminded of a couple of them recently because there was no one around to load on the trailer all the brush I had cut!   Lesson #1: If you care about keeping things spiritually “clean” in your life, there are going to be times when you have to do some “spiritual pruning.” Like physical brush cutting, sometimes the spiritual kind just requires a quick snip or two here and there with shears, cf. John 15:2 ; but other times, you have to get the machete or ax involved, cf. Matthew 3:10 . And occasionally, you have to fire up the chainsaw and really go to work! The level of effort required, and the seriousness of the tools involved, are usually determined by how long and how far we’ve let the briars and brambles of sin invade our lives. Consistent attention and diligence toward “nipping sin in the bud” eliminates most of the need for major hacking and clearing later.   Lesson #2:  Spiritual “chainsaws,” like their physical counterparts, once fired up and put to work, can often cut more than we can clean up! Once all the pruning and cutting is done, there is still a mess to clean up in order to put things right. This too is often hard work- perhaps even harder at times than identifying the problems, or our initial efforts to deal with them. Still yet, If we just “wade in and start hacking,” two things usually result: 1) we wind up cutting more than we intended, and some “good” parts get damaged or destroyed, cp. Romans 14 (especially vv.16-21 ); and unless we’re careful, 2) we almost always wind up making a bigger mess than we intended, or can clean up, cf. Galatians 6:1-5 .   Lesson #3: When loading brush, keeping the wind at your back means you get a lot less dirt in your face! “Keeping the wind at your back” while cleaning and loading up spiritual brush means having the God-breathed wind of inspiration behind you! God’s word not only tells us what’s good and what’s “brush,” Galatians 5:16-26 , it also provides instructions on how to go about dealing with the bad: don’t deny but do confess your sins to God, 1John 1:8-9 ; and, repent (change, turn from) and pray for forgiveness, Acts 8:21-22 . These inspired (literally God + wind or breath ) methods for loading and hauling away the spiritual brush in our lives as Christians keeps additional dirt out of our face because we have the very wind of God’s inspiration behind us! But trying to deal with our sins in some other uninspired way just means we have another face full of dirt coming. Doing things God’s way always works better, just like loading brush with the wind at your back.  Additionally, sometimes we’re called upon to help others with their spiritual brush. Here, too, we need the wind of God’s inspiration squarely behind us. Jesus tells us how to go about it in Matthew 18:15-17 . “If your brother sins,”  v.15a , is not the same as his doing something you don’t like or wouldn’t do. Be sure “sin,” as determined by the inspiration of God, is involved before you fire up your chainsaw! “Go and reprove him in private,”  v.15b , is not the same as telling everyone else but him what he has done wrong- go to him with the matter. “If he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you,”  v.16 , does not mean to turn this into a “witch hunt.” Remember, the point is to save his soul by having multiple witnesses confirm his need of salvation- not to destroy him. “If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church,”  v.17a , is the next to last step- not the first one. Nonetheless, the church has a part to play in dealing with spiritual brush that individuals refuse to clean up, v.17b . The only way to keep from getting additional “dirt” in your face when dealing with the “brush” of sin- yours or someone else’s, is to keep the wind of God’s inspiration behind you! Think on these things, won’t you?","Can one simply pray for salvation and receive it? Is reciting “the sinner’s prayer” what God requires of us for salvation? As always, the answers are to be found not by making sweeping declarations, but by examining what the Bible actually says. What I, or any man, thinks, preaches, or teaches carries no weight whatsoever unless the Word of God confirms it. So, let’s take a look….  There is no New Testament passage that instructs an alien sinner to simply pray for salvation, but there are four important examples that need to be considered- and each one has a vital lesson to be learned.  The first occurs in Acts 2 , on the occasion of the first gospel preaching done publically after Jesus’ death, burial, resurrection, and ascension. The crowd on Pentecost, through the sermon by Peter and the other apostles, became convicted of their sin(s) of having crucified Jesus. They asked, “Men and brethren, what shall we do?” They didn’t ask what to feel, or even experience, but what to  do   , understanding that salvation required activity on their part. Were they told to say “the sinner’s prayer,” or “accept Jesus into their hearts”? No, they were told to “Repent and be baptized for the remission of your sins…”  Acts 2:38 .  Secondly, consider Simon in Acts 8 . He was definitely told to “pray the Lord that, if possible, the intention of your heart might be forgiven you” in the last part of v.22 . But there are a couple of vital considerations here also. In the first part of the verse, he was told to “repent of this wickedness of yours and pray....”. So, praying wasn’t the only thing required. However, it should also be noted that Simon had already been saved by belief and baptism, just like the rest of the Samaritans, vv.12-13 . Peter’s command for him to pray for forgiveness was as a fallen Christian coming back to Christ, not a sinner coming to Christ for the first time.  The third important example related to “praying for salvation” is found in Acts 10 . It is obvious that Cornelius was a “devout man, and who feared God...and prayed to God continually,”  v.2 . For what was he praying? While we are not told specifically, the object of his petitions becomes apparent from the response of God to them. In v.4 he was told by God’s messenger, “Your prayers and alms have ascended as a memorial before God.” Then he was told to send for Peter. Why? Cornelius was devout, benevolent, and prayerful already- wasn’t this enough for salvation? Evidently not, for when Peter arrived, the text says, “He ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,”  v.48 . Cornelius, a believer, was evidently praying for salvation (undoubtedly among other things also), so God sent Peter to him that he might obey that which was still lacking: his baptism in Jesus Christ.  And finally, Saul of Tarsus is the fourth of our examples. Saul had been a persecutor of Jesus and the church, Acts 9:1-2,5 . Then Jesus appeared to him on the road to Damascus, vv.3-5 . But note carefully the words of Jesus to him in v.6 , “but arise, and enter the city, and it shall be told you what you must do.” Having this great personal experience with the King of kings, and even conversing with Him directly, did not fulfill Saul’s spiritual need with regard to salvation. So, he got up and went into Damascus as instructed, and spent three days and nights fasting and  praying   ,  vv.9,11 . Did this praying remit his sins and provide salvation? When God’s messenger Ananias arrived to tell Saul what he must do, what did he instruct? Notice the testimony of Paul (the Greek equivalent of “Saul”) on this point from Acts 22:16 when he recounts what God’s messenger told him, “And now why do you delay? Arise, and be baptized , and wash away your sins, calling on His name.” Ananias did not tell Paul to pray for salvation- he told him to be  baptized  for salvation. Though Paul had seen and conversed with the Lord personally, and now, as a believer in Jesus, had spent three days fasting and praying, he was told to be baptized to “wash away his sins.”   I realize that many today are told to “Pray the Sinner’s Prayer” or “Accept/Invite Jesus into your heart” to be saved, I just can’t find anyone in the New Testament who was told to do that. What I do find is that in every case of conversion in the book of Acts , three things occurred each time to produce salvation: 1) the gospel was preached; 2) the respondents believed; and 3) they were baptized for the remission of sins. Read it for yourself and see if this is not true, then please obey Jesus’ words given in the Great Commission of Mark 16:15-16 .","I confess some lack of understanding how some people can claim to believe in the eternal reward of heaven, but not in the reality of an eternal punishment in hell. Doesn’t the same Bible that tells of one also describe the other?  While it may be somewhat comforting to think that if we don’t want to “go to all the trouble” of doing what God says to attain eternal reward, that we can live as we want now and then just cease to exist at death, the Bible just doesn’t provide that option. Note 2Corinthians 5:10 in this regard, “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done , whether good or bad .” There simply is no “middle ground” here, for the Savior also said, “He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me, scatters,”  Matthew 12:30 . So, it is really up to us- God has done His part by graciously providing not only the  means  of salvation through the sacrifice of His Son, He also supplied the  instructions  on how to appropriate that redemptive price of Jesus’ blood, Titus 2:11-14 .  There are two great motivators in life:  love  and  fear.  God used  love  in that He showed us how much He loved us through the sacrifice of His Son, Romans 5:8 , in hopes that we would lovingly reciprocate by sacrificing our lives in faith and devotion to Him, Colossians 3:1-14 . But He also used  fear  to motivate us to do the right things; specifically, the fear of eternal punishment in hell. Note Jesus’ words of warning from Matthew 13:42 , “and they will cast them ( stumbling-blocks and lawless, from the previous verse) into the furnace of fire; in that place there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” In Mark 9:48 , Jesus further described hell as a place “where the worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.” If the notion of an eternal punishment composed of fire, worms, and pain sufficient to cause one to bite at himself and others like a wild animal doesn’t instill a healthy fear in you, well, then you may need to re-evaluate things!  But in all of the descriptions that are given of hell in the Text (see also Revelation 20:10 ; e.g. ), the things absent also arrest my attention. Note a few of them.  1) There is no  water  in hell. With all that fire, there is not a drop of water to be found. Do you remember how the “rich man” (of Luke 16 ) begged for even a drop of water “to cool my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame” in v.24 ? There is no relief in hell.  2) There are no  flashlights  in hell. When a storm causes a power outage, one of the first things we want is a flashlight. But hell is described as a place of “outer darkness,”  Matthew 25:30 . There is no way to see in hell.  3) There are no  fences  in hell. We use fences to either keep things in, or to keep things out. In hell, there will be no desire to keep what we have in, but there won’t be any way to keep the other bad things out either! Since inhabitants of hell will be sharing the abode with those cataloged in 1Corinthians 6:9-11 and Revelation 21:8; 22:15 , a fence would be a useful, but unavailable, commodity.  4) There is no hope in hell. We humans have been endowed with the ability to endure tremendous hardship and even torture, provided we can see an end or purpose to it. But with the eternal nature of hell (see Revelation 20:10 again), such a hope of relief or release is dashed. Instead, hope is replaced with eternal contemplation and regret for opportunities forfeited. Part of the punishment for the “rich man” of Luke 16 was an eternity to “remember,”  v.25 !  5) There is no God in hell. If we haven’t figured it out by now, the absence of God is what makes this place of torment “hell”! Physical death is the separation of the body and spirit, James 2:26 , but spiritual death, which is “the second death” of Revelation 20:14 , is the subsequent separation of the unrighteous spirit from God for eternity, Matthew 25:41 !  Please understand that our gracious and loving God doesn’t want anyone to spend eternity in hell, 1Timothy 2:4 , and has provided the opportunity for us to avoid it, but such does not change the reality of its existence, horrors, or inhabitants, Matthew 25:41 .","There were three crosses on Golgotha’s hill just before the Jewish feasts of Unleavened Bread and Passover in 33 A.D.- the cross of  Redemption   , the cross of  Rebellion   , and the cross of  Repentance   . On the cross of Redemption was crucified the Son of God, whose death was the propitiatory sacrifice for all of mankind. Beside Him was the cross of Rebellion on which hung a robber who railed and mocked Jesus even as they both suffered the agonies of death. But on the other side of Christ was a man who, though also a robber ( Mark 15:27 NASV, Romans did not typically crucify petty thieves; the word probably indicates violence, cp. Luke 10:30 ), turned his cross into one of repentance. When his cohort in crime castigated Jesus, he defended the Messiah while confessing his sin, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong,”  Luke 23:41 . And then his heart of repentance was manifested when he turned to Jesus and said, “Jesus, remember me when you come in Your kingdom!” Where and when this thief had come to knowledge of and subsequent faith in Jesus and His kingdom is not specified- but he obviously possessed them both. Thus, his knowledge, faith, confession, and repentance prompted Jesus to utter those blessed words, “Today you shall be with me in Paradise.”   Many today hang their hopes of salvation on this wonderful example of repentance. They want to be saved “just like the thief on the cross.” By this they usually mean without baptism, or any other “work” of salvation. But there is a problem with this desire- actually a few of them. Please consider the following.   1. Jurisdiction. The “thief on the cross” lived under the jurisdiction of the Law given at Mt. Sinai- the Law of Moses. It was God’s law for the Jewish people only ( Exodus 20:2,22; 24:1-18 ) from that time until Christ’s Law (the Gospel) became effective after His death, Romans 7:1-7 ; Colossians 2:14 . This law of God did not require baptism, thus Jesus did not require baptism of him for salvation.   2. Chronology. During His life, Jesus had taught the essentiality of baptism for salvation, cf. John 3:3-5 . This, like all other parts of His Law- the gospel, were taught in preparation for the time they would become of force. But, He did not issue the command requiring everyone to believe andbe baptized until after His death, burial, and resurrection, Mark 16:9-16 . The Hebrews writer makes it clear that Jesus’ law, His testament , became effective only after His death, Heb.9:16-17ff . Therefore, Christ’s command for all to believe and be baptized for salvation did not become “law” until the inception of His kingdom and law after His death (on the day of Pentecost, Acts 2 ). Thus , the thief on the cross died roughly fifty days before Christ’s law requiring baptism became effective.   3. Elements. Most everyone who wants to be saved “just like the thief on the cross,” in addition to not being aware of the two points above, have not considered exactly what all was entailed in this man’s salvation. He had  knowledge  of who and what Jesus was, otherwise he would not have appealed to Him for salvation, John 8:24 . He had  faith  (which is always based on knowledge from God, cf. Romans 10:17 ) that Jesus had the ability to provide his petition otherwise he would not have appealed to Him, Hebrew 11:6 . He  confessed  his own sin and the rightfulness of his punishment, as well as Jesus’ future position as King, otherwise he would not have appealed to Him, Romans 10:9-10 . He  defended  Jesus to others in obviously difficult circumstances, Matthew 10:32-33 . But, and don’t overlook this one, he also was  literally  and  agonizingly crucified for his sins!    Under Christ’s law, the crucifixion of the flesh is accomplished by putting to death our “old self” by being “buried with Christ” through baptism that we might rise to walk a resurrected life, Romans 6:3-7 . This method, and not to put too fine a point on it, is much better than being nailed to cross, hung up in the sun for all the world to see and ridicule, and having your legs broken after several hours of horrific pain so that you suffocated to death! Now, are you sure you still want to be saved “like the thief on the cross”? Or, wouldn’t you rather just believe and be baptized like Christ commanded?","In high school, my father was “the” and therefore“my” Vocational Agriculture teacher. So, participation on various judging and Future Farmers of America competition teams was pretty much compulsory for me. Some of them I enjoyed, and others- well, let’s just say I participated with better than mediocre but less than enthusiastic effort. But I enjoyed being on the Forestry Team. I liked trekking through the woods and learning to identify various trees of East Texas. However, being on the Forestry Team also meant learning to run a compass course- and it intimidated (OK, “scared”) me a little. You were given a compass and a set of directions which consisted of moving through the woods- briars, brambles, creeks and all, on a heading for a distance specified in hundreds of feet, then taking a subsequent compass heading for so many feet in a different direction, and so on until you arrived a pre-determined destination. Thus, you were graded on accuracy. I had been in the woods all my life, and wasn’t at all afraid of getting lost, but those compass courses consisted of several different headings for various distances, so any error made was multiplied and exaggerated by subsequent moves. Being only a degree or two off on your initial heading meant that you could be a really long way off by the end of the course!  There were two key elements to the Forestry compass course: 1) the heading- as determined by degrees on the compass; and, 2) being able to accurately walk a specified distance (no tape measures or other devices were allowed for this part). Reading a compass was fairly straightforward, but being able to accurately step off a specified distance took practice. The way we learned to do this was pretty simple, but tedious. Dad got us out in the open field behind the Ag shop and measured and clearly marked two lines one hundred feet apart. Then, using a normal gate, we walked that distance dozens of times- counting our steps each time. The rule was also simple: you could quit walking when you could consistently traverse the distance in the same number of steps each time. It’s been some thirty-two or three years ago, but the best I can remember, one hundred feet was thirty-four steps for me then. There was, however, still one problem- none of the compass courses required you to step distances of exactly one hundred feet! You’d be required to go sixty-seven feet on a heading of fifty-four degrees, then one hundred and thirty-four feet on a heading of two hundred and thirty-one degrees, and then etc. etc. etc. So, to be able to accurately step the correct distances, you had to use mathematics- specifically, ratio and proportion problems. Since you (presumably) knew how many steps it took you to go one hundred feet, using a ratio and proportion formula, you could fairly accurately estimate how many steps it would take you to cover any other given distance.  What has all of this to do with spiritual matters? There are a couple of comparative points to be made regarding the “spiritual course” of life:  1) Small errors in direction or distance are dramatically compounded in our spiritual course also. If we go “off course,” even in some way that we might consider “small,” and then proceed for a long while, or make several other subsequent “course adjustments” that were founded on the first deviation, we can wind up “missing the mark” of what God says by a really long way. Someone might object, “It really doesn’t matter what you believe/practice as long as you’re honest and sincere in it.” If such is true (and it patently is not, cf. Matthew 7:21 !), then you might as well throw your Bible away. In compass and spiritual courses, errors have a way of compounding themselves, so do your best to stay on the course God has given each step of the way!  2) Being able to work “ratio and proportion” problems can keep you on the right spiritual course. Ratio and proportion (multiplying the known number of paces per 100 ft. by distance specified, then dividing by 100 to arrive at the number of paces per the distance specified) is a way of fairly accurate estimation. In spiritual course running, you also have to begin with the “known” and “specified” to be able to arrive at the “unknown” and “unspecified.” This means “running your course” based on what has been “specified” by God in His word (and therefore can be “known” ( see 2Peter 1:3 and 2Timothy 3:16-17 ) to arrive at the “unknown” place of heaven, 2Corinthians 4:17-18 and 5:6-8 . You can’t go off in any direction for any distance you want, and expect to arrive at the desired destination. No “course” works that way, 2Timothy 4:7 .","Some folks seem to take their cues in religion from what God hasn’t said. Apparently, almost anything can be a part of a fellowship and church work or worship if “God didn’t say not to do it.” Let’s think about that logic and reason for a moment....  When giving Noah instructions for building an ark through which he and his family could be saved from the coming destruction of those who were unwilling to obey God, the Lord didn’t forbid him from using pine, oak, cedar, maple, sycamore, cypress, etc. Instead, God just told Noah what type of wood he could use , and that automatically eliminated the rest, Gen.6:14ff . God was silent on these other kinds of wood because He specified the type of wood He wanted Noah to use.  Likewise, when God specified through Moses that priests had to come from the tribe of Levi, Deut.33:8-11 , He didn’t have to forbid the tribes of Rueben, Simeon, Issachar, Dan, Naphtali, Judah, etc. All the other tribes were necessarily excluded when God specified Levi as the priestly tribe, cf. Heb.7:14 . God was silent on these other tribes because He had specified the tribe He wanted to serve as priests.  As priests, Nadab and Abihu were to keep fire burning on the altar of the Lord continuously, Lev.6:12-13 ; and fire used for other sacrifices and offerings was to be taken from this altar, Lev.16:12 . So, they were killed by God when they “offered strange fire before the Lord, which He had not commanded them,”  Lev.10:1-2 . Did God need to say, “Don’t use fire from here, or here, or there”? Not at all- when He told the priests from where the fire needed to come, every other place and source was automatically eliminated. God was silent on “other fire” because He had specified the fire He wanted to be used.  Now, let’s make a specific application of these things (though the same principles should guide all other applications also!). Most religions of today use instruments of music to praise God in worship. If asked why they choose to worship in this way, the answer is often, “God didn’t say not to use it.” Can’t we see that God didn’t tell Noah “not to use cedar,” or tell Israel “not to make priests from the tribe of Rueben,” or tell Nadab and Abihu “not to use fire from some other source” either? But God does tell us what “instruments” to use to praise Him in Ephesians 5:19 , “ speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;”. The  voice  and the  heart  were the instruments specified-not the violin and harp.  The objection usually raised to this is, “But they used instrumental music to praise God in the Old Testament!” They sure did, but please answer this question: “ Why did they use instrumental music in the Old Testament to praise God?” 2Chronicles 29:25 provides the answer, “He stationed the Levites in the house of Lord with cymbals, with harps, and lyres, according to the command of David and of Gad the king’s seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for the command was from the Lord through His prophets.” God specified instrumental music for Jews under the Law of Moses in the Old Testament. We are Christians under the Law of Christ in the New Testament. Where is God’s specification of instruments of music besides the voice and the heart in the New Testament?  “But weren’t the first Christians Jews?” Absolutely, and yet any reputable historian or bible encyclopedia will tell you that mechanical music was not a part of Christian worship until late in the seventh century A.D. when Pope Vitalian decreed it as an acceptable form of worship. Overwhelmingly, instrumental music in worship was rejected by all the major Protestant denominations (and their leaders such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, Charles Spurgeon, and John Wesley) until the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. But more importantly, why did Jewish Christians, who were accustomed to using mechanical instruments to worship God under the Old Testament Law, suddenly abandon the use of them in Christian worship? Again, the answer is simple: “Neither God, Jesus, nor the Holy Spirit (or men inspired by Them) authorized the use of mechanical instruments in the New Testament for Christian worship.” There was no need to say (or write), “Don’t use this or that mechanical instrument” because God had specified the voices and hearts of Christians singing praises to Him. There are at least nine N.T. passages that specify  singing  praises to God, Matthew 26:30 ; Acts 16:25 ; Romans 15:9 ; 1Corinthians 14:15 ; Ephesians 5:19 ; Colossians 3:16 ; Hebrews 2:12 and 13:15 ; and James 5:13 . But, though mechanical instruments were readily available, and had been a part of Jewish worship, there is not one N.T. passage that specifies using one (or several) for Christian worship. Apparently, early Christians understood that the silence of God did not authorize this, or any other practice. Does it really make that much difference? Ask Nadab and Abihu. Please study, reflect, and think on these things carefully.","Our house sits on a fairly flat plateau that is a good seven or eight feet above street level. The yard is nearly two acres and has a lot of “road frontage,” so I had a good long look at the approaching pick-up from the seat of my lawnmower as I mowed on the cusp of the embankment leading down to the street. It was a beauty! Its jet-black paint job was polished to a mirror finish as the late afternoon sun soon peaked through trees creating flashes of gleaming light as it wound its way toward me. It was “chromed out” with little pieces of sparkling trim all over it- false engine exhausts appeared to be ported through the fenders, and the headlights, mirrors, and taillights all sported buffed chrome. The wheels were fitting for a Roman Emperor’s chariot, intricately cut and highly polished aluminum wheels enveloped by thin but wide rubber soles that were as black as deep space. This “ride” was simply dripping with “bling” and oozing with sparkle and shine! It was something to behold as I peered down from the elevated “bleacher seat” atop the lawnmower at the passing parade- that is, until it passed below me….  The top of the cab was unpainted and splotched with rust! All that polished chrome and mirror-finished paint was on a truck with an unpainted top. It looked spectacular (depending on individual tastes, of course) from ground level, but from above the splotches of paint and pockmarks of rust made it look like it belonged in the auto graveyard! I nearly fell off the mower laughing, but after I regained my composure, my mind immediately went to the passage in Matthew 23:27 .  Jesus said, “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness.” The old King James Version uses the phrase “whited sepulchers” instead of “whitewashed tombs” (as does the NASV). Either way, the meaning is plain: The view from the side is very different than the one from above! Just like that pick-up, which looked great from the side but horrible from above, these whitewashed tombs gleamed from the mountainsides in the morning sun like daisies. But from above, the divine perspective instead saw the putridity of death and ugliness of decay. What a vivid image and assessment the Lord made of these supposed “leaders of religion”!  All of which goes to show that we can “polish” and “chrome” the exteriors of our lives all we want, and fool those “on our level,” but the view of God “from above” manifests the internal reality. In fact, we can fool our contemporaries with “whitewash” (or chrome and polish) to the extent that they even applaud our “spirituality” or holiness. However, in Luke 6:26 , Jesus again emphasized the distinction between man’s and God’s view of such things, “Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for in the same way their fathers used to treat the false prophets.” The assessments and accolades of those “on our level” do not influence the divine perspective for it comes “from above.” And God explained through His prophet Isaiah, “For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways…. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts higher than your thoughts,”  Isaiah 55:8-9 .  There is one more point I’d like add to these things. Although Jesus was speaking to the religious “leaders” and those who fashioned themselves as such of His day ( cf. Luke 20:46 ), the problem of the “whited sepulcher” facade is not one that is limited to church leaders then or now . It has the same eternal consequences for everyone- leader or lay person alike. Note Matthew 18:5-7 in this regard, “And whoever receives one such child in My name receives Me; but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck, and to be drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe to the world because of its stumbling blocks! For it is inevitable that stumbling blocks come; but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes!” These things should cause us to respect even more, and desire to emulate even more, the divine perspective of Nathanael- of whom Jesus said, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile (or deceit, NAB95) !”","I miss non-computerized engines and automobiles. My old diesel “Big Truck” (as it was affectionately known before I wrecked it) wouldn’t run over sixty-two miles per hour unless going down a big hill out of gear (it was in gear and only going about 40 mph when wrecked). But if you had a mind to, you could crank the window down, turn off the key, pull it from the ignition and throw it out that open window and that truck would still run that same sixty-two miles per hour because there wasn’t an “electronic” anything on it! It had no computer, and only mechanical sensors that made it easy to work on and repair- aside from the size and weight of the parts!  By contrast, now even the key you put in the ignition switch has a programmable computer chip in it, which is why they’re so big and cost so much to replace! New vehicles, big or small, now have at least one on board computer, and seemingly countless sensors for everything from O 2 (oxygen) to CPS (crankshaft position sensor) to OSS (transmission output speed sensor) and ISS (transmission input speed sensor) to etc. etc. etc.! All of this electronic gadgetry means that newer vehicles: 1) are very efficient and do amazing things automatically that we never even know happens; and 2) can be extremely hard for us old shade-tree mechanics, who don’t have computer diagnostic equipment, to repair! Those of us who knew how to use feeler gauges to set the points, and a timing light to advance or retard the ignition timing to make an engine “purr,” are just about out of luck now.  But as frustrating as all of this “electronic stuff” on current vehicles can be, it also has another advantage that older ones never had- they can diagnose themselves! That OBD (on board diagnostic [computer]) can provide a tremendous amount of information about what is going on with the various systems on the vehicle…if you have the electronic scanning computer to plug into the vehicle’s OBD to retrieve the information! Fortunately, some vehicles will flash alphanumeric codes (instead of the mileage display on Jeep/Chrysler, for instance) that provide significant information without having to attach them to an outside scanning/diagnostic computer. This is tremendously helpful, if you know how to retrieve and read the codes!  Believe it or not, all of this “mechanical” complaining and information has a spiritual point. Our modern “computerized” vehicles have incredible abilities for self-diagnosis  if  you know where to look, and how to retrieve the information. So does the soul! Several New Testament passages emphasize the importance of “self-diagnosis.” 1Corinthians 11:28 says “But let a man examine himself…”  2Corinthians 13:5 adds that we should “Test yourselves…” and Galatians 6:4 adds that “each one should examine his own work….” But like these newer vehicles, just understanding the  benefit  of self-examination or self-diagnosis is not the same thing as knowing  where to look  and  how to retrieve  and  “read”  the information! God didn’t provide us with an OBD (on board diagnostic), but He did give a “tool” that we can plug into to see what’s wrong and how to fix it. It’s called the New Testament.  Notice carefully the language of James 1:23-25 , “For if any are hearers of the word and not doers, they are like those who look at themselves in a mirror; for they look at themselves and, on going away, immediately forget what they were like. But those who look into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and persevere, being not hearers who forget but doers who act—they will be blessed in their doing.” Merely glancing or looking at the Bible from time to time is like noticing those diagnostic codes without committing them to memory or writing them down. Soon they are forgotten or ignored without making any corrections. That “Check Engine” light is on your instrument cluster for a reason, and ignoring it usually has consequences that become more costly with time. Ignoring the flashing “Check Soul” light on our spirits by not “checking the code” and making the necessary repairs/corrections has eternal consequences that far outweigh any earthly cost. On the soul, “checking the code” means we look deeply into “the mirror” of God’s Word to see ourselves as He sees us, and thus self-diagnose the problem(s). Then, we make the make the necessary repairs/corrections to be able work as He intended, and avoid the spiritual junkyard of hell!","I grew up (to the extent I did) the son of vocational agriculture teacher and lived on a farm, so doing “no work at all” has never been part of my life experience. I think my first “away from home job” cutting and bailing hay was during the summer that I was thirteen, and then started a “real” job at a tractor and equipment auction the following year. Since then, I have been “out of work” for almost a full week in about 35 years. Now, I could get fired tomorrow (or even today!) and perhaps be without a job for an extended period before securing another one. But such would result from someone else’s choice rather than mine! On the other hand, folks who choose to do “no work at all” are an entirely different matter.  There is a huge difference between those who can’t work and those who won’t work. However, exactly where that line of “disability” begins is pretty subjective. I’ve seen a man with one leg and crutches (no prosthetic) mowing his yard with a push mower! I’ve also known of people with a “disability” for which they received governmental support who could out-work or out-play me physically any day of the week! The difference is often simply “want to”- which is probably just another way of saying “pride plus motivation.” The one-legged man was too proud to allow others to do for him what he felt he could do for himself. Conversely, there are many in our society who are more than willing for others to do for them what they could and should be doing for themselves!  The New Testament has a simple solution for this problem, “  For even when we were with you, we gave you this command : Anyone unwilling to work should not eat . For we hear that some of you are living in idleness, mere busybodies, not doing any work. Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living . Brothers and sisters, do not be weary in doing what is right. Take note of those who do not obey what we say in this letter; have nothing to do with them , so that they may be ashamed ,”  2Thessalonians 3:10-14 . Let those words really sink in, especially the ones in bold print. Following this “command” of the Lord will solve a lot of problems. But a cautionary reminder is in order: this passage is talking about those who are  unwilling  to work, rather than those who are  unable  to work.  However, this article is not really about social commentary or reform. It just so happens that congregations often contain the same problems in them that are common in society. Churches are all too often filled with capable people who are more than willing to sit back and reap the benefits of others’ labor without lifting a finger themselves. Just to be clear: Churches, like society, have far too many members who are  unwilling to work , but are not  unable to work!   These are those who expect the building to be immaculately clean, but don’t mind leaving “their pew” scattered with hymnals and trash. They also expect there to be “good” bible classes available for adults and children, but never bother to sign-up to teach one, or “work” toward preparing themselves to do so. They are happy when visitors attend, and enjoy having big crowds at services, but never quite get around to inviting or bringing anyone themselves. Theylike “inspiring and uplifting” worship services but don’t really participate by “singing from the heart,” or by taking a leading role in any aspect of the worship. They think the church ought to “do something with/for the young people,” but are never the ones hosting a class or get-together for them. They…. never mind, you get the point.  While many of us are all for “if any will not work, neither let him eat” in the world, it might be another thing entirely for the same principle to be enforced in the local church. Isn’t such thinking a goose and gander kind of thing? But think about it: What if those not “working” in the church were somehow prevented from enjoying the benefits of anyone else’s labor in it? If we understand and favor the rule for others with regard to secular work, shouldn’t we also be willing to abide by in the spiritual work of the Lord?","Before I was old enough to have better sense, a Jr. High coach talked me into running track. After only one additional year of maturation, I decided that much running should involve chasing a ball, or at least hitting one so someone else had to run after it! But, since I said “yes” when asked, and both ran and jumped fairly well (then!), the 100 yard hurdles became my assigned specialty. I use the term “specialty” very loosely because, as I remember, the little country school I attended might have had one or two broken and discarded hurdles with which to train, such was about the extent of it! Nonetheless, the day of the district meet arrived, and I lined up with the rest of the lads who had doubtless also been duped into competing....  The gun sounded and I was off like a flash- OK, at least a spark. I ran and jumped and ran and jumped and…you get the point- until the finish line was crossed. Though my friends cheered my apparent win of this particular heat race, something was wrong. None of the judges came up to me to secure my name and school affiliation. So, I stood there aimlessly celebrating my feat until I heard one of them say, “Lane #4 (or whatever it was) is disqualified.” It seems that although I cleared all the hurdles cleanly, and finished ahead of all the other skulls full of mush, I had accidently landed on the lane marker when completing one of the jumps. “But it was an accident,” I thought- I didn’t mean to step on the line, nor did I gain any advantage by it. Nonetheless, my day (and track career) was done. I couldn’t win that fifteen-cent blue ribbon everyone else seemed to crave…which didn’t really bother me much at all.  All of that reminiscing was to introduce this: Paul wrote to the Corinthians about competing “according to the rules” in 1Corinthians 9:24ff . The Corinthian brethren were well aware of the illustrations of running and boxing that Paul used since the Isthmian Games were held near there every two years. These contests were the ancient forerunners of our modern Olympics. But Paul has a couple of spiritual applications from these events for the Corinthians that we might also do well to consider.  In vv.24-25a , he focuses on the principle that in order to win, one must compete “according to the rules” - a lesson the introductory story of my disqualification also well illustrates. But his point is that the practice of Christianity has “rules” which must be likewise obeyed in order to receive the ultimate prize of salvation. Desire, intent, and effort are certainly necessary, but are of themselves insufficient. One must also “Run in such a way that you may win,”  v.24b . He further states that competing for the spiritual reward requires that one “exercises self-control in all things,”  v.25a . Believing that you can win, or even that you have won (again, like me in my race), is not the same thing as obeying the rules, nor are they substitutes for it.  In v.25b , Paul highlights the importance of the point of the illustration by saying that in the games, a “perishable wreath” is the prize. But he quickly adds that the Christian race is for the “imperishable” prize of eternal life. This “race” isn’t for the accolades of friends, the personal “thrill of victory” over temporal opponents, a fifteen-cent ribbon, or even for a woven wreath of olive branches that will surely dry and deteriorate overnight. Instead, the prize for running according to (God’s) rules is eternal life. Therefore, one must run this race with the precise purpose of eternal life, v.26 !  In v.27 , Paul also adds a significant application to the illustrations- that of disqualification. Many people have been taught that once a person is “saved,” they can never be “eternally lost.” Aside from the fact that 26 of the 27 books of the New Testament refute this doctrine, it just doesn’t coincide with Paul’s inspired words here. If the “prize” of running the Christian “race” is eternal life, and it surely is, then why is he emphasizing the importance of “self-control” and running “in such a way” (according to God’s rules rather than our own) “that you might win”? Additionally, if a person is “once saved always saved,” why is Paul so concerned with and making every effort to keep from being “disqualified”? The Christian “race” surely can be won- obviously with God’s help and grace, and the imperishable prize of eternal life attained- but one must run in such a way as God determines lest he be disqualified!","While Jesus was training the twelve disciples to become “fishers of men” ( Matthew 4:19 ), He also told them, “I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now,”  John 16:12 . Have you ever wondered why this was so? Though we are not specifically told, I suspect that the answer has to do with growth, development, understanding, and time. With their spiritual growth and development, their understanding would increase so that as the events of time unfolded, they would later be able to “bear” truths that they currently could not.  It’s really not any different for would-be disciples today- it often takes some growth, development, and time for us to really understand and be able to “bear” (practice) some of Jesus’ words. For instance, consider His statement recorded in Acts 20:35 , “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” (By the way, though these words are quoted by Paul and recorded by Luke- both through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, they are not otherwise recorded by any of the four gospel writers.) When we are younger- in life or in faith, we may admit that such is true in principle, but have a hard time really seeing the value of it in practice!  But, the principle was not given as a maxim to promote a “holiday spirit” of charity, nor was it provided to be relegated to mere gift-giving applications. Jesus is instead describing a code of conduct in life for those who would be His disciples. While still immature in faith, we may submit to this rule because we know it is right, but not really “feel” the way we should about it. In other words, we may do the right thing in this regard without really believing or seeing the value in it ourselves. But with the growth and maturity that time allows, true understanding of the principle is gained. Let’s consider some specifics to illustrate our point. Do you think (in your mind), feel (in your heart), and believe (in your soul) that it is better for y ou  to give:   · Attention rather than to receive it? Or do you still crave, or even demand other’s attention like a little fella who wants everyone to focus on him? Read Philippian 2:1-4 , please.  · Support and Encouragement rather than to receive them? Are you one who always expects others to “help” and/or “support me,” but never seems to be found on the giving end of the matter? Please read 1Thessalonians 5:14-15 .  · Compassion and Sympathy rather than to receive them? Do you always expect others to listen to and commensurate with all your troubles and how “bad” you feel, and to provide sympathy and compassion to you, but rarely (if ever) are truly compassionate and sympathetic to anyone beside yourself? Read Colossians 3:12-13 , please.  · Education and Enlightenment rather than to receive them? When it comes to spiritual education and edification (to build up), are you a “giver” or just a “taker”? Please read Hebrews 5:12-14 .  · Forgiveness rather than to receive it? Are you one who wants (and expects) everyone else to forgive you whenever you ask- and whether there is any true sorrow for the offence or not, but are very begrudging when it comes to forgiving others? Read Ephesians 4:32 and James 2:13 , please.  · Love rather than to receive it? Do you desire or even demand unconditional love from others, but are quick to place conditions upon the love you give? Please read Matthew 5:44-48 .  Now do you see why some divine directives require the growth and maturity that only time and experience can provide to really understand, “bear,” and practice? While we are yet spiritually immature, we would much rather  receive than give  all of these things. In fact, our still adolescent faith may not allow us to be able to  give  them at all. Have you matured in your faith sufficiently to not only understand, but also to “bear” the principle that “It is more blessed to give than to receive”? If not, then maybe it is time to get busy and “grow up”!","The question of our title is admittedly lifted from its context in 2Peter 3:11 . The sentence from which this questioning phrase is taken is not really even a question as much as it is a rhetorical statement. But the purloined part is exactly what I’d like us to consider, so please forgive the poaching. Think about the query posed, “What sort of people ought you to be?” Though Peter surely meant it to be both personally instructional and introspective, consider it relative to your children . Let’s rephrase it as, “What sort of people ought  your children  to be?”  It’s all too easy to give overly simplistic and platitudinous answers to this kind of question, such as, “I want my children to be good Christians ”- though we may not be really sure how to define a “good” Christian vs. a “bad” one. The end productof our child-rearing efforts should be Christ-like adults. If we don’t have this goal firmly fixed in  our  minds as we lead and direct them when they’re young, it is very difficult for  them  to become “the sort of people they ought to be” as adults. To that end, think with me about a few core-principles and values that will help them to be children that we can proud of now, and adults that God will be proud to claim later. Obviously, even the best parenting efforts can be undone by rebellious adult offspring, cf. Hosea 7:13-15 , but surely we can make every effort to help our little ones to be:    Cooperative rather than Competitive . We have turned the world into such a competitive place that each one thinks that he has to “get ahead” of everyone else. In the process we’ve forgotten how to cooperate with one another - “Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor,”  Ecclesiastes 4:9 . Children who are taught to be excessively competitive tend to put down and demean others to illustrate their own presumed superiority rather than encouraging and helping them in a spirit of cooperation and mutual accomplishment, cf. Hebrews 12:12-13 . Unless we steer them differently, they will lack basic compassion and tend to be overly critical of others and their perceived short-comings (where would they possibly learn that?). It’s no surprise therefore, that employers are constantly searching for applicants who can “work well with others”!    Humble rather than Haughty . Perhaps these are linked to, or even stem from, the previous pair. Cooperation requires humility (biblically, humility refers to regarding others as more important than self,  cf. Philippians 2:3 ), but an overly competitive nature often belies selfishness, and promotes arrogance and haughtiness. It seems that currently, our competitive natures not only demand that we defeat our competitors, but that we also demean and belittle them and arrogantly tout ourselves in the process. Is this really the “sort of people we ought to be”?    Helpful rather than Harmful. Some people will “go out of their way” to help others, and some will “go out of their way” to harm others. These traits don’t just “show-up” in adults. Instead, they are instilled by the education, example, and encouragement of their parents in people when they are children, either positively or negatively. Children are taught to be abusive or assistive toward others and their property, and both are the result of underlying attitudes. Abusive behaviors often stem from failures to be taught proper respect for others and their property. A generation (or two?) has been so overdosed on self-respect and positive self-images that perhaps many have become “self-centered,” and have thus lost the proper regard for others.   Demure rather than Demanding. “Demure” is not a common word in most of our vocabularies. It is an adjective that basically refers to being modest. “Modesty” is often (correctly) associated with clothing, but has just as much to do with our attitudes and how we conduct ourselves. The demure or modest person doesn’t demand everyone’s attention, nor expect everyone to bow to his/her wishes. Like all the other negative traits covered, we teach our children, or encourage or allow them, to become demanding of their own way and our attention. Proverbs 30:31a warned of the outcome of such, “The leech has two daughters, ‘Give,’ ‘Give.’” We can teach our children to be demure or demanding- but we will reap the harvest of the seed we sow.  Surely there are other attributes that will, if taught and encouraged in our children, help them grow into Christ-like adults. If we want our children to be mature, independent, kind, trustworthy, gracious, and loving people, we have to teach them to be the same kind of children.","Several years ago, when I was “hairless” due to chemotherapy, I was feeling pretty well one day so Donna and I decided to get out of the house and go somewhere. I was in the shower when she came happily bee-bopping into the bathroom to “fix” her hair. Without really thinking it through, she accusingly asked, “Did you use up all my hair spray?” I slowly pulled back the shower door, stuck my bald head out and said, “No, and furthermore I didn’t wear out your hairbrush or use up all your shampoo either!” Realizing what she had said, she quickly apologized, and we both had a huge laugh. Reflecting on this story started me thinking…  Do realize how many hair-care products there are on the market? Shampoos are advertised with everything from fruit to acai berry antioxidants in them. There are seemingly an endless array of conditioners, de-tanglers, anti-frizz, straighteners, curlers, color-enhancers, color-changers, and even hair grower/restorer products available. And besides these, all sorts of clippers, trimmers, irons, crimpers, and styling tools are constantly being advertised. Evidently, a lot of us pay a tremendous amount of attention to, and money on, our hair!  The Bible is not devoid of discussion on the topic of hair either. Those taking the Nazirite vow first shaved their heads, burned the hair on the sacrificial fire at the tabernacle, and then didn’t cut their hair again until the completion of the vow, cf. Numbers 6:2-21 . Absalom, King David’s rebellious son, though certainly not under the Nazirite vow, was dramatically jerked from the mule he was riding when his long and thick hair became entangled in tree branch under which he rode while being pursued, 2Samuel14:25-26; 18:9-14 (he was later killed by Joab while still suspended there). The boys who teased God’s prophet Elisha about his “baldhead” were certainly taught a lesson. Elisha “cursed them in the name of the Lord” and then two female bears came out of the woods and “tore up forty-two” of them! And who can forget Samson, whose miraculous strength was so closely tied to his hair- because of his Nazirite vow, that when it was finally cut he became powerless to fend off the Philistines, Judges 13:2-5; 16:1-21 ?  The New Testament also has more than a few references to the hair of the head. 1Corinthians 11:1-16 indicates that the hair can bring either glory or dishonor depending on how it is kept and worn. 1Timothy 2:9-10 and 1Peter 3:3-4 also warn against elaborate or showy hairstyles, as they are contrary to the godly spirit of modesty and discretion. One of the most touching specific mentions of hair surely must be the penitent woman of Luke 7:36ff . Mary, the sister of Lazarus ( John 11:2 ), wet Jesus’ feet with her tears and wiped them clean with her hair! Then too, of course, is Jesus’ statement in Matthew 5:36 , “Nor shall you make an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.” Obviously, Jesus never met Miss Clairol!  But to me, the most striking “picture” given in the New Testament of human hair has to do with God’s numbering of them. In Luke 12:1-7 , Jesus is speaking specifically to His twelve disciples about their role in preaching the gospel, and the dangers they would face in doing so. In this context He tells them not to “be afraid of those who can kill the body, and after they have no more that they can do,”  v.4 . He then warns them to fear instead, “the One who after He has killed has the authority to cast into hell,”  v.5 . Fear can be a great motivator! But He then bolsters their faith and confidence with these words, “Are not five sparrows sold for two cents? And yet not one of them is forgotten before God,  v.6 . God’s omniscient (all-knowing) powers are incredible! They are, however, not limited to sparrows for the next verse adds, “Indeed the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear; you are of more value than many sparrows,”  v.7 . As incredible as the omniscience of God is, such is not really the point here. Instead, Jesus is telling His disciples that God’s intimate knowledge of each of them should give them confidence in Him to save their souls even if men should kill them for their preaching of the gospel. God not only knows and cares for His own, but He will ultimately bring them to His eternal home if they fear, love, and obey Him!  Though these words were spoken to the Twelve, God knows about your “hair” too- and will likewise do the same for you…if you also fear, love, and obey Him.","It was simply a gorgeous day- I was “off” work and had vowed not to even turn “on” a computer. Time was right to catch-up on some outside chores at home, and what a beautiful day for it. The birds were flitting around in such a seemingly joyful way that they couldn’t help but sing. The difficulties of winter were finally over. Flowers were exploding into cascading blossoms that filled the air with a sweet but tangy fragrance. It seemed that you could almost see buds bursting forth into unfurling leaves. The soil was again soft, moist, warm, and rich with life. After buying a battery for the lawnmower, there was no doubt about it, Spring was officially in full bloom.  It doesn’t normally take much more than an hour to mow our fairly large yard, but on this occasion I was in no real hurry. The Spring grasses (and weeds!) were thick and wet, and the remaining wild winter rye stems were tough, so I was just easing along on the mower so it would cut smoother. Besides, I was also towing a six-foot steel roller weighted with a couple of pieces of railroad iron to help it flatten out all those gopher mounds and mole runs while I mowed. So, I had plenty of time to enjoy the beauties of God’s creation that were on display all around me.  Mowing has always been good sermon or article-thinking time for me. It doesn’t require a lot of concentration to go around in circles that get one width smaller with each pass! So the mind naturally wanders- and if I can get it to wander in the right direction, reflections on God and His creation inevitably sprout. On this particular day, the challenge was not to elicit those types of thoughts, but to limit them- it was just that kind of day! Perhaps they will help you also.   Spring reflects the goodness of God.   Romans 1:20 tells us that God’s “invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made…” God’s eternal power is evident within the complexity and symbiotic (interdependent and mutually beneficial relationship) nature of the creation- none of which “just happened by chance.” The eternal power of God made it happen! But, if you think about it, God could have created a monochrome world of varying shades of gray that was capable of sustaining a utilitarian existence for us- but He didn’t. Instead, He gave us a world that not only met all of our essential needs for life, but also exceeded even our wildest imaginations of wondrous beauty and phenomenally intense color. The goodness of God’s divine nature didn’t just provide us with a world to keep us alive. He gave us a world in which we could really enjoy living by exceeding our aesthetic desires also. Spring manifests the goodness of God’s divine nature!    Spring delivers a witness of God.  In Acts 14 , Paul and Barnabas performed a miracle of healing at Lystra. The pagan people there were so impressed that they began to worship them- giving them names of Greek gods. To refute this and give proper glory to God for the sign, Paul responded with these words, “And in the generations gone by He (God) permitted all the nations to go their own ways; and yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness,”  vv.16-17vv.16-17 . The warm rains and sunshine of Spring fuel the fruitful seasons of Summer and Fall. These are also evidence of God’s love and provision for all of His creation. They serve as a yearly witness to all who look, listen, and learn of God’s enduring endowment to the world.   Spring promises the renewal of  resurrection.  A couple of years of relative drought have taken their toll on many of the trees here in East Texas. Just a couple of weeks ago, I was trying to figure out the best way to remove a huge Elm tree that had fallen prey to the dry conditions. I sure hated to lose the towering tree, and procrastinated and put off the job. Now it is covered with budding leaves! Spring has amazing powers of resurrection. Though the tree was not truly “dead”- every visible shred of evidence indicated that it was. So too it is with our “death”- it is in reality just a peaceful slumber in which we await the great resurrection through which we will spring to eternal life, cf. John 5:28-29 and 1Corinthains 15 . As I marveled at everything “coming to life” again after winter’s slumber, I could not help but reflect on the renewal of life at that great day of resurrection! Spring is truly a beautiful witness of God and His goodness if we take time to notice and consider it.","“And Abel was a keeper of flocks, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. So it came about in the course of time that Cain brought an offering to the Lord of the fruit of the ground. And Abel, on his part also brought of the firstlings of his flock and their fat portions. And the Lord had regard for Abel and for his offering; but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard,”  Genesis 4:2b-5a . Our first, and entirely human reaction to the Lord’s rejection of Cain and his offering might be one of confused sympathy.  It seems somewhat harsh and reactionary for God to treat Cain so unfavorably. After all, Cain was attempting to worship and honor God. Cain was also sacrificing of his own possessions - deliberately and willingly giving up something that he had undoubtedly worked very hard to produce,in the attempt. Additionally, Cain was using his talents to serve and worship God. And oh by the way, God hadn’t said not to offer fruit and vegetables, had He? All of which creates, initially at least, sympathy for “poor Cain”- he seems to have tried so hard, and done what he could to serve and worship Jehovah! How could a loving, just, and merciful God treat Cain so contemptuously? Why would He have such apparent disdain for Cain’s honest and sincere efforts?  As is always the case when “we” find fault with God, there is more to the story than we understand when we do so. Please consider carefully the inspired commentary of Hebrews 11:4 on the matter, “By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain…” Those first two words of the verse are of vital importance. What does it mean to act “by faith”? Again, let God provide the inspired answer, “So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ,”  Romans 10:17 . There is just no other possible conclusion: God told Cain and Abel what sacrifices were to be offered, and how they should be presented. What this all boils down to is that Abel did what God said, how God said  to do it.   But unfortunately, these things also tell us more about Cain’s attitude and actions. He was not honestly and sincerely doing the best he could to use his talents and abilities to serve God the best way he knew. Instead, he was contradicting divine directives by giving God what he wanted to, calling it “worship” and “sacrifice,” and then expecting God to accept it. That’s rebellion- not faith; and that’s not worshipping God- it’s worshipping “self,” cf. Philippians 3:19 ! I realize this may be how we want to see Cain and his sacrifice, but it is not how  God  saw it.  Now let’s get the rubber on the road, so to speak. We are no better than Cain when we today substitute our desires for God’s will, call it “worship,” and then expect God to accept it because it’s what we want to give Him. When Cain did these things, God said he was “of the evil one,”  1John 3:12 . Why wouldn’t God feel (and say) the same things about us, if we do the same things Cain did? He does, and will, Matthew 15:8-9 , “This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far away from Me. But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men.”   Read your New Testament- it is the law of God under which we are to operate, Luke 16:16 . If God didn’t specify a particular act as proper “worship,” then it cannot be “of faith” and will not be accepted by God as such. Calling something “worship” that God didn’t, and then seeking to justify our actions by claiming they are “honest and sincere” uses of the talents God gave us didn’t work for Cain, and won’t work for us either. We can appeal to all the human reasoning we want to get “our” way, but our end will be the same as Cain’s in the judgment of God- and after all, it’s His judgment that counts!  The Hebrew writer says of Abel, that “though he is dead, he still speaks,”  Hebrews 11:4 . The same could be said Cain. Please listen to them both in regard to not only your faith and its practice, but also your worship of our great God, won’t you?","Spiritual amnesia” is not a condition limited to the seasoned/mature Christian population- younger and less mature Christians can also suffer its effects. This spiritual forgetfulness can have some positive benefits, as well as some negative liabilities depending on the application .  On the positive side, having spiritual memory issues can be a good thing, especially when it comes to the ability to forget past failures and move forward toward future successes. Paul wrote to the Philippians regarding this very point, “…forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus,”  Philippians 3:13-14 . The great apostle would be the first to tell us (and he did so) that he had a lot in his past that he had to overcome. He was ever aware of his past rejection of Christ and persecution of the church, cf. 1Timothy 1:15 (he considered himself the foremost of sinners). So how could he both forget what lay behind and remember the magnitude of his past sins?  Paul never forgot that he had committed those sins, and even allowed them to motivate him to greater fidelity and service. But what he did forget was the guilt of those sins. He accepted the forgiveness of Christ, and was therefore able to forgive himself. Note 1Timothy 1:16 on this point, “And yet for this reason, I found mercy, in order that in me as the foremost (sinner) Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience, as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life.” He put into practice what we often fail to do: forgive ourselves by accepting the forgiveness of Christ when we meet His terms, and then forgetting the guilt of our sin!  But, there are also some negative aspects of “spiritual amnesia.” Consider the following carefully.    Hebrews 12:5-6  , “and having forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons, ‘My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when you are reproved by Him; for those whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives.” We sometimes forget that having God as our spiritual Father means that we occasionally need a good scourging! No one enjoys this kind of discipline from God, but if we forget that He does it for our good and because He loves us, we might either regard it lightly or faint- or rebel against it and Him, and quit even trying to do what it is right.    James 1:23-24  , “For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror; for once he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was.” There are a couple of things we need to understand from this passage to get the point. The mirror is God’s word- it shows us our natural face , which is a reflection of our faults. But if we look into this mirror and then go away from it and  forget  what we saw without making any corrections, we are just “hearers” rather than “doers” of God’s will. Remember, it is the “doers” of the word who are blessed of God, cf. v.25 !    2Peter 1:9  , “For he who lacks these qualities is blind or short-sighted, having forgotten his purification from his former sins.” Again, a few things must be brought into clear view to “see” Peter’s point. The qualities he has been urging to be added to our initial faith are listed in vv.5-7 . They must be increased and grown to produce usefulness, fruitfulness, and true knowledge,  v.8 . When we fail to add these qualities to our faith, Peter says that we become blind or short-sighted. This means that we will not be able to really “see” the truth any longer, and/or that we will not be able to see past the earthly and temporary things of this life to the spiritual and eternal goal of heaven. He also says it will cause memory loss with regard to our purification. Peter has specifically mentioned a couple of things that produce this purification: obedience to the word ( 1Peter 1:22 ), and baptism ( 1Peter 3:21 ). The point is that if we fail to grow and mature as Christians, we will forget that baptism is a birth that is supposed to be followed by growth, maturity, usefulness, fruitfulness, and true knowledge! Then, we will become apathetic, complacent, and may even quit!  While “spiritual amnesia” can be beneficial with regard to our former (forgiven) sins, it can also be very detrimental to our overall growth and development in the Cause of Christ and the pursuit of heaven!","If you went to bible class as a youngster, you probably remember a song about a man named Zaccheus. You know, “Zaccheus was a wee little man, and a wee little man was he. He climbed up into a sycamore tree for he wanted the Lord to see.” Aren’t you glad this is a printed article rather than a live lesson so you don’t have to listen to me sing? As is often the case, at least for me, the “children’s” stories and songs we learned way back when have some real “grown-up” lessons included too- if we will just revisit and restudy them as adults.  Do you remember the story of Luke 19:1-10 ? Jesus came to the ancient city of Jericho. It was destroyed by God as the Israelites initially entered Canaan, cf. Joshua 6 . After the fall of the city, Joshua pronounced a curse upon whoever might rebuild it. Thus, 1Kings 16:34 records the fulfillment of that curse upon Hiel, the Bethelite, for that reason. Jericho was situated near major fords that allowed commerce to traverse the Jordan River. Therefore, it was a suitable place for a “chief tax-gatherer” like Zaccheus to reside and work. Evidently such was profitable work, for Zaccheus is described as “rich,”  v.2 . But this job also came with notable liabilities. Since the taxes were being collected and sent to Rome  from  the Jews typically  by  their countrymen, the “tax man” was despised and hated. Zaccheus apparently fit into this category.  But, being the “tax man” wasn’t his only challenge. As Jesus came near to the city, evidently a large crowd gathered. Zaccheus wanted to see Jesus, but because he was “small in stature,” he couldn’t see over the crowds, v.3 . However, he was determined- so he ran up ahead of the procession and climbed up a sycamore tree to enable a better view, v.4 . Such was surely neither a noble nor respectable activity for a man of his position, but Zaccheus didn’t allow these things to deter him! In what certainly must have been an embarrassing situation, at least at first, Jesus stopped the parade, looked up into the tree at Zaccheus, called him by name, and said, “hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house,”  v.5 . Zaccheus not only complied with Jesus’ demand, but “received Him gladly,”  v.6 . Though he did not directly deny the charge of being a “sinner,”  v.7 , he did voluntarily offer “half of my (his) possessions” to assist the poor if he had defrauded anyone, v.8 . For both his attitude and activity, Jesus pronounced Zaccheus to be a “son of Abraham,”  v.9 !  Let’s put the particulars of the story in perspective. Zaccheus did not get   “caught up in”  or  trust in either his position or wealth  . Do you, cf. Luke 12:33 ? Do these things prevent you from a close personal relationship with Jesus? Zaccheus was not deterred by obstacles- even his inherent one(s) , from “seeing” Jesus. We have all been given characteristics by our parents- either genetically or perhaps from teaching and training, that can be obstacles to our “seeing” Jesus (certainly the inverse may also be true). Do you allow your physical or spiritual inheritance to prevent you from truly “seeing” Jesus, cf. Matthew 10:34-37 ? Zaccheus, when presented with the opportunity to be with Jesus, offered no hesitation or excuse, but joyfully responded immediately.  How long have you been delaying your obedience or excusing your disobedience to the invitation of Jesus, cf. Luke 14:15-24 ? Zaccheus also penitently offered to make restitution for whatever wrongs he had committed. While restitution cannot be made for some sins (murder, etc.), are you refusing to repent of your sins- and perhaps even denying their sinfulness, cf. Luke 13:3,5; 24:47 ? Please understand: If an activity, lifestyle, or relationships was “sinful” prior to salvation, it is not made “holy” after salvation.  Salvation came to Zaccheus because he: did not trust in his wealth or position; was undeterred by obstacles- even the inherent ones; did not hesitate, delay, or offer excuses when faced with the Truth, but joyfully responded with acceptance and obedience; and allowed true repentance to repair what could be fixed from the past, and to amend his future course. Perhaps the song about a “Wee Little Man” didn’t convey all of those lessons, but the attitude and activity of Zaccheus as told through the inspiration of Luke surely did!","Last Monday I was out in the shop repairing a damaged headlight, and had the radio on while I worked. The stations are pretty limited in a metal building, so the radio was tuned to one of only a couple of stations that would come in clearly. I wasn’t really listening, but the “host” caught my attention when he began to give parenting advice. Since the Bible also has good deal to say about this subject, my interested was piqued. He quoted unnamed studies that sought to quantify the harm done to children when their parents yell at them. But the logic fascinated me. Apparently, parents that forgo corporal punishment have a difficult time getting their children to respect and obey them. And since, according to the host, “time out” and “sending them to their room” often have little effect on their behavior, parents have increasingly resorted to yelling at their children. Evidently, the only “teeth” manifested in efforts to discipline their children are shown when yelling! The best that I could follow the point of the piece, the results of the study were that “yelling” might be just as detrimental to the psyche of a child as spanking. Go figure.  Don’t get me wrong- yelling is certainly not a good form of discipline. But, the lengths to which our evolved society will go to avoid the “wise counsel” of God on this subject is truly amazing. The book of Proverbs is replete with divinely inspired parenting guidance. It includes corporal punishment ( 13:24 ; 19:18 ; 22:15 ; 29:15-17 ), but contains so much more, cf. 1:8 – 7:27 ! What emerges from this and other biblical texts on effective discipline (training) is that it must include three elements: 1) education so that they know the right things; 2) encouragement so that they understand why these are the right things; and 3) enforcement so that the right things are obeyed. While the punitive aspect is vital to insure that non-compliance has unpleasant consequences, without the instructive and inspiring aspects, “discipline” soon becomes manipulative and tyrannical. No one is encouraging you to “beat” or “abuse” your children- such would surely violate Ephesians 6:4 ; Colossians 3:21 ; and the overall purpose of godly discipline. But remember, discipline without corrective and punitive measures is just advice!  Surely we understand these principles from everyday life. Who wants to live in a society without lawsthat specify and encourage right conduct, and law-enforcementthat punishes violators? Not me- such would be chaos! But sadly, chaos is exactly what exists in far too many homes where “enlightened” parents refuse to educate, encourage, and enforce discipline. Teachers are leaving schools in droves because they cannot teach children who have not been properly disciplined at home to be respectful and obedient.  But the strongest case that corrective/punitive measures are to be included in discipline comes from God’s treatment of His “children.” While the Old Testament certainly contains “rules” by which God’s children were  educated  in what was “right” and “wrong,” and it contains a multitude of examples wherein God  encouraged  them to understand and obey “for their own good” (as in Deuteronomy 6:3 ), it also is filled with examples of His enforcement of His laws through punitive measures ( see 1Corinthains 10:1-11 )! Did God not “love” His children? Wasn’t He afraid punishment would damage their psyche, or His relationship with them? Did He avoid punishment because He wanted His children to love rather than fear Him? Hebrews 12:5-11 makes it crystal clear that God disciplines, including punitively, His children precisely  because  He loves and wants the best for them!  There should be no doubt that love is a better motivator than fear.  1Corinthians 13:13 says that love is even greater than faith and hope . But, our “perfect Parent,” God the Father, also utilizes punitive discipline, and the fear of it, to help enforce right conduct until love and respect can develop and grow as we mature. Why else does He tell us of the horrors of hell in Mark 9:42-48 , or of His past punishment of angels, cities, and the whole world in 2Peter 2:4-6 ?  Should children “fear” their parents? Not unless and until they violate the training their parents have instilled through education and encouragement- then they should fear the punitive results of their own conduct their parents lovingly but consistently employ! But this is just the example and instruction of the Creator of the Universe. Obviously our evolved and enlightened society surely knows better…. and continues to reap the unfortunate and disastrous results of it everyday!","“A month of Sundays” is an old expression that typically was used to mean “a long time”- as in, “I haven’t seen you in a month of Sundays!” But like many such expressions, the true meaning is not exactly like, and is sometimes just the opposite of, what was intended. For instance, have you ever tried to “shoot fish in a barrel”? The water deflects the bullet and splashes so much that you can’t even see the fish after the first shot, let alone hit one! So too it is with “a month of Sundays”- though perhaps used to mean a “long time,” it actually can be a very short one- at least from one perspective. Please consider…  Sunday rolls around once every week, obviously. Therefore, it would take 30 or 31 weeks of real time to make “a month of Sundays”! If we pursue the math further, it would then also take seven years to produce “a year of Sundays”. That sure sounds like a long time!  But let’s turn this around a little, and look at it from a different perspective. If you attend religious services “every Sunday,” how much actual time are you devoting to worshipping God, encouraging your brethren, and learning from God’s word? A person 21 years old will have will have had 3 years total of spiritual devotion, but only    if   he has attended every Sunday, and spent all day at it for all 21 years of his life! What if, on the other hand, he has only committed one hour to his weekly devotion, or has only made half of the Sundays? The numbers drop dramatically, and it obviously takes a lot longer to make a “month” or “year” of Sundays, doesn’t it?  Let’s make one more comparison while we’re at it. The average school age child spends roughly seven hours per day at school for 175 days per year for a total of 1,225 hours per year. When we multiply those 1,225 hours of instruction by twelve years of education, we get 14,700 total hours needed to graduate (obviously these are very general numbers given just for comparison purposes). If we “study” the Bible for one hour per week every Sunday morning, do you know how long it will take to equal the “graduation level” of 14,700 hours of public education? It would take 287 years !  That’s enough math- now let’s get the rubber to the road, so to speak. If we only spend one hour per week studying our Bibles at the Sunday morning service, we can’t live long enough to match the equivalent (in instruction time) of a high school education. That “month of Sundays” doesn’t sound like much of a long time anymore, does it? Is there any wonder that many who claim to be Christians are at best “remedial,” if not “illiterate,” in real knowledge of God’s word?  Actually, we’re being generous with the “one hour per week” estimate of instruction from the Bible in most congregations for the Sunday morning service. I don’t know of any congregation that consistently has hour-long sermons anymore, and such isn’t the point either. Instead, the point is that if we believe attending a religious service (even every Sunday morning) and receiving one hour of instruction (even if such really happened) is going to be sufficient for us to be mature Christians who know “the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation” ( 2Timothy 3:15 ), we are sadly mistaken- if not self-deluded.  Some of us are proud of ourselves when we “attend church” almost every Sunday morning. Don’t misunderstand, that’s a great start. But please don’t place on “the preacher” the burden to pour into your heart and mind what you need to know to reach heaven in one 30 or 40-minute sermon once a week for 300+ years! Instead, why not give true “ diligence to present(ing) yourself to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, handling accurately the word of truth,”  2Timothy 2:15 .  The noble-minded Bereans had it right. They: “received the word with great eagerness”­- the right attitude;  “examining the Scriptures daily” - the right practice ; “to see whether these things were so”- the right purpose , Acts 17:11 . The rewards for that kind of commitment to really understanding and living God’s word are truly “out of this world”!","Randy Moss thinks he is the greatest (NFL) wide-receiver of all time, yet the statistical numbers reveal that although he might be in the top ten, he is far from the greatest. His self-perception is out of touch with reality, which reminds me of Gal.6:4 , “For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.” There is no doubt that Mr. Moss is a great “big play” receiver with tremendous talent- but it is also equally clear that he is a “diva” with a bad attitude that doesn’t give 100% to the team and its goals. He is much more interested in self-aggrandizement and self-promotion. The sad reality is that he probably could have been “the greatest ever” at his position if he had been willing to work hard on every play- whether he was the “featured,” or “first option,” receiver or not. But this he was not willing to do. He was more concerned with the spotlight for himself, than with the win for the team.  It strikes me that many of us (including me!) are sometimes like Mr. Moss in that we, too, are more concerned with our own “spotlight” or making the “big play” than with the overall good of the team. We’re more concerned with personal glory than with God’s glory. So, we take passages like Matthew 5:16 , “Let your light shine before men…” in the wrong way- thinking that we have to be the “bright star” that everyone sees. This leads us to constantly shining our “lights” in other people’s eyes to be sure they see how bright, shiny, and brilliant it is. Such misses the point of the passage entirely. The whole verse instead says, “Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” There are a couple of vital points that must be understood to correctly interpret and apply Jesus’ words.  For one thing, note that our lights are to be shone  “before”  men rather than “at” them. Our goal is not to show them how “bright” our lights are so they will realize how good and holy we are- such is a purely Pharisaical approach ( cf. Luke 18:11-12 ). Note specifically that the “brightness” of our respective lights is actually nowhere considered in Matthew 5:16 ! The only aspect of their brightness is “that they may see your good works…” It does not take a bright light in a world of seemingly total darkness to provide spiritual perception and clarity- it just takes a consistent light. One that is always “on”- not just when everyone is looking, or when the occasion is right for a “big play”!  Consistently and constantly doing the “right things” is of much more value in allowing others the opportunity to “see” and “glorify God” than some “big” or “flashy” play every now and then (in keeping with the football metaphor and Randy Moss). Remember, the purpose of others being able to “see your good works” is to allow them to “glorify your Father in heaven”- not you (or me)! Our examples are supposed to be about getting the win for the team, which is God and those on His side opposed to Satan and sin, rather than about personal glory or self-aggrandizement!  Look, it is easy to put out maximum effort for one play when you are going to be the featured player. It is another matter entirely to consistently give every play your best whether you get the ball and the spotlight or not. But, God is concerned with constancy. “Constancy” has much to do with consistency- it is freedom from fluctuation and change.  The New Testament (the NASV at least) doesn’t use the words “constancy,” or even “consistency”- but it has a lot to say about “steadfastness.” Steadfastness is that quality or state of being consistent; without the vacillation of highs and lows. Steadfastness is not about making the “big play” or having “the spotlight,” it is about always doing the right things in the right ways. To switch illustrations for just a moment, many of us would undoubtedly be willing to make the “big play” of dying for Jesus and our faith in Him. Are we just as willing to consistently and steadfastly live for Jesus every day, and every moment of every day?  Do this: take the time to read 1Corinthians 15:58 ; Colossians 1:11,23 ; 1Thessalonians 1:3 ; 2Thessalonians 3:5 ; Hebrews 6:19 ; and 2Peter 3:17 ; and reflect upon the value of constancy, consistency, and steadfastness in your daily walk with Christ. Then, allow your “light”- whether big and bright, or weak and dim, to be seen by others in such a way that the path to Jesus is illuminated for them through how you live your life every day.","A couple of men from here at Southside get together each Tuesday morning for breakfast with Bro. J.C. Balch (you’re welcome to join us at Beverly’s Cafe, 7:30!). As Bro. J.C. is on the plus side of ninety years old, we enjoy his stories from yesteryear.  The last time we met, he told us about some of his early work experiences in Austin where he substituted for the “PBX” (private branch exchange) telephone operator. This experience was considered valuable by the military when he enlisted (WWII). But what struck me as funny was what he was told by the officer making the work assignments for incoming personnel. After stating that they already had several coming that were specifically trained in military communications systems, he told J.C., “We don’t have time to train you, so we’ll just put you in charge!” So, due to his lack of training, J.C. was made the corporal in charge of the trained men!  This reminds me of the cliché, “Those who can’t do, coach”- with apologies to coaches who can usually “out play” their charges with knowledge and experience even if their talent and abilities have diminished due to age. Such things are usually said or written by “Monday morning” or “armchair coaches” who have never had any “training” at coaching, and probably can’t play either! Believe it or not, the New Testament addresses these issues of training and teaching in the spiritual realm in a couple of passages.    James 3:1 states, “Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, knowing that as such we shall incur a stricter judgment.”  James is not in any way diminishing the role, responsibilities, or need for bible teachers. In fact, he is doing just the opposite, by indicating that those who do teach should have adequate preparation for the task in knowledge, experience, and wisdom. There are always some who want the supposed “prestige” of being a teacher without having first done the necessary work to educate themselves. Paul mentioned this to Timothy by way of warning, “…wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions,”  1Timothy 1:7 . This leads us to our next point.   There is always a need for bible teachers- both public and private, “who because of practice have trained their senses to discern good and evil,”  Hebrews 5:14 . Such does not require a degree in theology, or even formal training, but it does demand dedicated commitment to, and understanding of, the basic principles and purpose of the Scriptures. In Acts 8 , Christians driven from their homes by persecution “went about preaching the word,”  v.4 . These were not apostles (they stayed in Jerusalem, v.1 ), or even trained evangelists, but they were Christians of deep faith who earnestly desired salvation for others- and were willing to work for and toward that goal. Consider Matthew 5:13-16 , the salt and light passage. It was not spoken or written to the preachers and pastors, but to those with the most power to teach by daily contact with, and example to, the world! But again, this leads us to another (and final) point.   Preachers and Pastors should know how, and be active in, teaching- “preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with great patience and instruction”   2Timothy 4:2 .The reason for Paul’s admonition to Timothy is also given in the next verse, “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance with their own desires; and will turn away their ears from the truth…” Simply put, those primarily responsible for the public proclamation of God’s word, i.e. preachers and pastors (see also 1Timothy 3:2 and Titus 1:9ff ) should be capable private teachers also. As in other aspects of Christian duty, they should, in fact, set the example for others to follow in this regard, 1Peter 3:3 ! Perhaps all too often, preachers and pastors view their roles as being pulpit-oriented; and such is surely part of their responsibilities as the passages above indicate. But, given that they are supposed to be men of knowledge, wisdom, experience, and ability, shouldn’t they also be leading the way in the more private work of personal evangelism?  Kitchen tables and coffee tables are just as effective as pulpits in teaching the gospel- probably more so. Let’s use them all to tell others of the wonderful salvation offered by Jesus Christ whether we are preachers, pastors, or just Christians with genuine love and concern for the souls of others.","Think about it: God spoke light into existence on the first of the six days of creation (yes, these were twenty-four hour days rather than eons or millennia, Genesis 1:5,8,13,19,23,31 ; Exodus 20:11 ); but the “greater” and “lesser lights” were not created until the fourth day, Genesis 1:14-19 . So, what was the source of the light created on day one until the sun was created on day four? The “source” was surely the power of God manifested through His  Word   ,  cf. John 1:1ff ! What magnificent power was manifested through the Word of God- sufficient to speak into existence ample light to illumine the world!  The power of God’s word to transform a “formless and void” sphere into an inhabitable planet that provides creation’s every essential, and even esthetic, need is not the only example of its abilities to create or convert. When the prophet Jonah was sent to great and exceedingly wicked city of Nineveh, his message from God was simply and direct, “Yet forty days and Nineveh will be overthrown,”  Jonah 3:4 . While I’m fairly certain this wasn’t the sum total of God’s word to the Ninevites that Jonah proclaimed, the power of whatever was said is obvious, “Then the people of Nineveh believed in God; and they called a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least of them…”  cf. vv.5-9 . The word of God transformed these exceedingly violent and wicked Assyrians into penitent believers- so much so that “God saw their deeds, that they turned from their wicked way, then God relented concerning the calamity which He had declared He would bring upon them. And He did not do it,”  v.10 !  Other examples of the transforming power of God’s word- such as Israel being turned from idolatry during the reign of the boy-king Josiah, or the great persecutor of the church, Saul of Tarsus, being converted into an ardent proclaimer of the gospel, the apostle Paul, could be given. But hopefully, the point has been sufficiently made: God’s word is extremely powerful, and has great transforming abilities!   I’m not suggesting that Jacksonville is a “great and exceedingly wicked city” like Nineveh- but it does need the transforming power of the gospel. Everyone everywhere needs it! The apostle Paul declared it to be “the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes” in Romans 1:16 . Nothing has changed in that regard. If one is going to be saved, it will be by obedience to the gospel, 1Peter 1:22 . And, if people are to be saved by God’s power through the gospel, it necessarily follows that it must be preached- simply, plainly, and fully. Consider Romans 10 on this point, “How then shall they call upon Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? …So then faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ,”  vv.14,17 .  To these ends, Brother Kris Emerson (of Beaumont, TX) will be preaching the gospel in love, power, and enthusiasm at the Southside Church of Christ, Sunday, February 10 th  , through Wednesday, February 13 th  . Kris will speak “words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household” ( Acts 11:14 ) in their full and powerful saving grace with all dignity and love. Won’t you come and hear the gospel? It is God’s power to save by the blood of Jesus Christ!  Service times are as follows: Sunday, 9:30 and 10:20 AM, and 6:00 PM; Monday through Wednesday evenings at 7:00 PM. We are located at 602 Henderson Street (directly across from Payless Shoes and Subway Sandwiches on South Jackson St.) You will be welcomed warmly, and treated with the utmost respect and dignity. Nothing will be said or done to in any way embarrass or offend anyone. Won’t you please join us in this spiritual feast upon God’s word?","Repentance is a requirement of salvation, Luke 13:3,5 . Some folks say that it is the most difficult of all the obligations God has specified. They may be right. But as with most things God requires of us, repentance becomes more problematic when we: 1) don’t really understand exactly what it is; and/or, 2) go about it wrongly. Hopefully, what follows will help in both regards.  Getting an accurate definition of repentance is vital. Repentance is not simply changing your mind- as such does not address the activity. Likewise, repentance is not just changing your activity- for such does not necessarily address the mind. From these things, it would seem that repentance is a “change of mind that leads to a change of activity/action.” While this is a pretty good basic definition, perhaps one additional element would help. Think about repentance as “a change of mind that leads to a change of activity/action and results in a change of allegiance” ( see Romans 6:16-18 ). With hopefully a better understanding of what repentance is, let’s consider a few examples of how we typically fail to do it right, and thus make it more difficult.  1) We propose  timed repentance.  We tell ourselves, others, and even God that we will “straighten up” at some future date on the calendar, or after some event occurs in our lives. This is the notion behind spiritual resolutions tied to January 1 st . The other form this one takes is that “I’ll straighten out my life after ____ (I: get out of college; or get married; or have children; or get settled in my career; or become successful; or etc.).” This one also often incorporates the “wild oats” logic- that is, “Have fun now, repent or straighten up later.” This surely can’t be true repentance because although it acknowledges the propriety of doing God’s will in the mind, it rebelliously delays obedience to God’s will until later and substitutes instead “my” will now. Our activity hasn’t really changed at all.  2) We attempt  conditional repentance   . We try to “strike a deal” with God- such as, “Lord, if you will do this/that for me, then I will quit _____.” God is not Monty Hall (for you younger folks, he was the famous host of the long-running TV game show, “Let’s Make a Deal”)! I suppose we think that in this arrangement, to which God never agreed, by the way, if God doesn’t come through with “His end of the deal,” then we are freed from our obligation to repent. This is not repentance because the mind has not really changed- we’re just offering to restrict our activities on a conditional basis contingent upon God fulfilling our wishes.  3) We practice  reluctant repentance.  In this scenario, we understand the need for repentance in our minds, at least for eternal self-preservation, if nothing else, and we curtail our activities to bring them more into compliance to God’s will, but we’re not really happy about it. It usually goes something like, “I’d really like to ____ (fill in worldly activity of choice), but I can’t because I’m a Christian (sigh).” In this case, we may indeed be doing the “right” things, and even refusing to participate in the “wrong” ones, but our heart is certainly not in it! Our mind understands, and our activities are in compliance, but our allegiance has not really changed.  Obviously, none of these situations constitutes the true and necessary repentance that God requires. True biblical repentance, on the other hand:  a) Is motivated by sorrow for sin . It is not being sorry “I got caught,” but genuine distress for having disappointed God, 2Corinthians 7:9 . Our minds are changed because we understand that we have failed to carry out “the will of God.”   b) Is without regret. There is no reluctance or regret in changing our activities to come into compliance with God’s word because our true desire is to please Him rather than ourselves, 2Corinthians 7:10 . Our activities are thus changed, not because we “have to,” but because we “want to” be pleasing and useful to God. Now our allegiance has necessarily changed also, 2Corinthians 7:11-12 .  So, have you truly repented so that your mind, activity, and allegiance have changed? Or, are you just going through the motions of putting on some outward show of feigned contrition, cf. Matthew 3:8 ?","This is not an article on the relative advantages and liabilities of public vs. private (home) education. Each has its benefits, and each has its costs. Some send their children to public school because they don’t have the time, inclination, or ability to educate them themselves. Others start with grandiose or even noble ideas about “home-schooling” their children only to become less than diligent regarding the matter, and wind up doing a poor job of providing them with an education. Simply put, there are failures and successes on both sides of the comparison ledger. Obviously and ultimately, parents must take all the factors into consideration, and try to decide and do what they feel is best for their children. But again, this is really not the point of our title question.  As fathers, Ephesians 6:4 lays the responsibility to raise our children “in the discipline and instruction of the Lord” upon us. Such isn’t a requirement that is particular to the New Testament. As a part of the Law of Moses, Deuteronomy 6:1-9 , required extensive “home-schooling” of their children pertaining to the will of God of every Hebrew father. The fact there weren’t many other options for educating children in the ways of God at the time doesn’t at all diminish the point. Note some specific instructions given them in this regard:  · Love the Lord your God with all  your heart  and all  your soul  and all  your might  , v.5 . Before any father can begin to “home school” his children about the Lord and things spiritual, he must first invest his whole being in loving God himself.  · The  words  of God’s commandment must likewise be on his heart, v.6 . It is not enough to simply feel the right way about God, the “home schooling” father must also know what Jehovah commands. Remember, this is about education- and such requires that specific knowledge of the Lord, His ways, and His requirements be known before it can be taught. One cannot teach what he does not first know.  · Then, with these prerequisites in place, the “home schooling” father can begin  diligently teaching  these things when he sits in the house, when he walks by the way, and when he lies down and rises up,  v.7  . This process of educating is not something that is accomplished by reading a bedtime story from the Bible to a toddler, but is an on-going part of every facet of life and its experiences. It is both a constant and continual effort of raising the child that undergirds every aspect of the father’s association with him.  · The commands of God must be bound as a sign on the father’s hand, and as frontals of his forehead, v.8 . This probably refers to the Jewish practice of placing portions of Scripture in small pouches that were tied to the wrist (presumably to help steer or direct the hand to do God’s will), or around the head as a band with the pouch resting upon the temple (to help steer or direct the mind). The idea here is that God’s word is both to control the father’s own thoughts and actions, as well as being an example or sign for the child. “Do as I say, not as I do” has never worked- and never will because children learn as much (if not more) from what their father does as what he says.  · Finally, the Word of God should be written on the doorposts of the house, and on its gates , v.9 . Thus, the first thing the child sees either coming or going from the house is the Law of God. This continual reminder serves as reinforcement to what the father has loved, demonstrated, and taught. But it must also be understood that simply plastering biblical passages and platitudes in and around the house does little good if the father has not first loved and demonstrated them in an exemplary way.  While Bible Classes at the local congregation level can be tremendous assets, and ought to be utilized by godly parents to the fullest extent possible toward the spiritual education of their children, such can never replace the “home school” of a father taking his responsibility seriously to be the spiritual head of his family ( cf. Ephesians 5:23ff ) and raise his children “in the discipline and instruction of the Lord” ( Ephesians 6:4 ). Let’s face it fathers, God didn’t ordain local congregation bible classes to provide the spiritual education for your children, He ordained you to do it! Take that responsibility seriously, or you will likely raise spiritual illiterates instead of strong Christians who will become your spiritual legacy.","The birth of a child is a blessed event. It brings such joy and happiness- and responsibility. As parents, perhaps for the first time in our lives, we learn what it means to give unconditional love. Probably also for the first time in our lives, we feel the awesome responsibility of what it means to have someone else be completely and totally dependent upon us. This tremendous onus causes some parents to become obsessively compulsive about matters of nutrition, cleanliness, health, and general care of the child. The doctors are barraged with phone calls, visits, and questions about every tendency and trait of the child- whether real or imagined. Constant comparisons are made to other children with regard to growth-chart percentiles, and other developmental abilities. In short, anything and everything is tried or done that could possibly provide any advantage for growth and development for this new “bundle of joy!” But let’s think about some of these things in a spiritual connotation.  Being “born again” ( cf. John 3:3,5 ) on the basis of faith and through the waters of baptism is the process by which one becomes a “new creature” ( 2Corinthians 5:17 ), or “newborn babe” ( 1Peter 2:2 ), in Christ. In many ways, spiritual growth and development parallels its physical counterpart. Spiritual growth requires attention to nutrition, cf. 1Peter 2:1-2 ; rest, Philippians 4:6-7 ; cleanliness, 2Peter 2:20 ; and exercise, 2Peter 1:5-8 . These things are a lesson unto themselves, but are not here the direct focus of our attention.  What happens when a physical child doesn’t grow, develop, and mature according the normal order? There is immediate concern, investigation as to the preventative cause, and corrective and additional assistive steps are implemented. But what happens when a  spiritual babe in Christ does not grow, develop, and mature? Is there a parallel level of concern, investigation, and assistance given? Sadly, such is usually not the case. Spiritual family members (fellow church members), parents (those who taught and brought them forth by the gospel), and grandparents (church leaders) are typically not nearly as concerned about growth, development, and maturity as physical parents, despite the eternal consequences which are implied by the deficiency. Thus, “Maybe he will grow eventually” becomes the sad response to the situation. Why does this lamentable circumstance exist?  Perhaps there is one overlooked or unrealized key truth to these matters: We fail to recognize that one cannot continue to live in a state of perpetual infancy. As a physical child that, for whatever reason, fails to grow will die, so too will a spiritual child that fails to develop beyond infancy perish. One just cannot remain a babe, or child, perpetually- physically or spiritually! How we fail to grasp this point in the spiritual realm while so clearly comprehending it in the physical one is unfathomable. Doesn’t the Parable of the Sower clearly teach this lesson in Matthew 13:21 ? The young plant that sprouted in the rocky soil had “no firm root in himself, but is only temporary , and when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he falls away .” Having “no firm root” is surely an indication of a lack of growth and development that seals its fate. But please remember, this part of the parable is not about dying “plants”- but dying Christians who fail to grow and mature!  Let’s extrapolate these things to one more point: Churches composed of perpetual spiritual infants will suffer the same tragic fate as its individual members. Why is this so? It is the spiritually mature who reproduce! Spiritual infants are not sufficiently developed, obviously, to reproduce. Thus, churches will not, and in fact, cannot, survive in a state of perpetual infancy. A congregation that does not grow, develop, mature, and reproduce will die.  I fear that we, generally speaking, have become all too comfortable with the notion of perpetual spiritual infancy. If so, whether sooner or later, spiritual death is inevitable. The good news is, however, that it doesn’t have to be this way- we can, and must  think and do better! So, let’s take seriously the task of raising and rearing babes in Christ to spiritual maturity for their ultimate good, and the long-term good of the Cause of Christ!","Proverbs 22:28 reads, “Do not remove the ancient boundary (or landmark, KJV) which your fathers have set.” The boundary, or landmark to which the writer refers was probably a property or tribal territory marker. However, folks are sometimes tempted to interpret and apply the injunction in a much broader way to include traditions related to spiritual matters. When a favorite way of doing some aspect of the service, or some long-held belief is challenged as being only “traditional” rather than “scripturally mandated,” the quick-draw retort is often to appeal to Proverbs 22:28 , “Don’t remove the ancient landmarks!”  Landmarks are usually placed with deliberate intention and consideration. Such markers should not be removed ill advisedly, or without due consideration of who placed them, and why they were put where they were. In other words, “Don’t remove old markers just because they’re not new.” Surely the wisdom of these words is easily discerned, so why make a big deal about it?  In every generation, or perhaps at least in every other one, there is a general rebellion against the “old” in favor of the “new.” This relates to more than just styles of hair and clothes. Younger folks are sometimes opposed to anything that has been around longer than they have, and are conversely in favor of anything that has come about in their own time (even if it is only being recycled from past generations). Thus, the novelty of the new is deemed favorable to the antiquity of the aged. “New” ways of doing “old” things are favored just because of the relative age of each. This generational desire for the novelty of the new is usually rebuffed by the members of the older generation in favor of the ancient landmarks of the past. But the truth is, either of these perspectives can be just as wrong as the other.  Without dismantling the proverbial admonition, the ancient should not be favored just because it is old anymore than the new is to be rejected just because it is recent! The value of each must be measured by its merit. Any doctrine, or the practice of it, must stand or fall on the veracity of scriptural soundness. And, any way of doing something is only “sacred” when it is specified in the sacred text. A new way of doing something that is a matter of judgment (and therefore not mandated in the text) is not “wrong” or “bad” just because it is different any more than the old way was “right” or “good” just because it is “the way we’ve always done it.” However, caution should be exercised in both directions regarding these matters.  Holding tenaciously to the ancient ways just because they are “the way we’ve always done it” lends itself to some dangerous consequences. Perhaps the most obvious of these potential pitfalls is that we tend to make traditional matters of judgment or expediency into “law.” Thus, on which side of the communion table the bread is placed becomes all too important. Or, having one song, a prayer, two songs, the Lord’s Supper, and then the sermon becomes the only “right” way to order a worship service. No passage specifies any such things, and these types of tendencies need to be altered to remind us of that fact. Being unwilling to try something different or new that is itself acceptable according the Scriptures, is arrogant in that it assumes there isn’t a better or more conducive way to accomplish the needed objective. It thus lends itself to ritualistic repetition, stagnation, alienation, and isolation.  But on the other hand, an unquenchable thirst for the novelty of the new also has its own set of problems. For instance, having a dramatically different order of services every time the congregation meets can become confusing and a distraction to the overall purpose of the assembly, which is to worship. To desire a “change” just for change’s sake can ignore the possibility that there may be good and reasonable reasons why something has always been done a certain way.  Most of us are creatures of habit- which is not necessarily a bad thing, unless those habits become so entrenched in our thinking that we forget they are not “law.” Conversely, constantly desiring something “new” and “different” ignores the potential value of “tried and true.” The good news is that these two philosophies don’t have to be mutually exclusive. We don’t have to “change everything” to keep things fresh, and we don’t have to “leave everything just the way it is” to remain faithful either.","As the New Year begins, self-evaluation and enthusiasm for self-improvement is typically at an annual high. There is usually a whole host of things about ourselves we determine to improve. On this list are often at least a couple of items pertaining to our level of interest and activity. In other words, there’s something (or several) at which we resolve to do a better job of cultivating interest and improving activity. So, we vow to either get up earlier or get off the couch more often to accomplish this resolved commitment. Such things got me to thinking about the “sluggard” of Proverbs , and the excuses he put forth for his lack of interest and activity.   “Sluggard” is not a common word in our current vernacular, but it is often found in the book of Proverbs . However, it is not a hard word to define- it simply means plain old “ lazy .” There are some thirteen references to “the sluggard” in this book of wisdom, depending of course on the translation. Most of them refer to his lack of initiative and industry in making a living for himself and his family, and warnings of the incumbent results of such. But let’s see if we can use the words of one of the primary texts dealing with the subject relative to more spiritual matters. It seems to me that most of us tend to get more “lazy” with regard to our spiritual obligations than perhaps we do with our physical responsibilities. To that end, let’s take another look at Proverbs 26:13-16 .  There are four key attributes of a sluggard given in the text.  1) The sluggard  imagines obstacles   ,  v.13 . He says, “There is a lion in the road! A lion is in the open square!” A real lion might be an obstacle, cf. 1Peter 5:8 , but not to a real man of God, cf. Daniel 6:16-24 ! But real obstacles are not so much a problem for the spiritual sluggard as the imagined ones. When we find ourselves inventing reasons not to do what we know we ought to and can do, we’ve surely become a spiritual sluggard!  2) The sluggard  goes nowhere   ,  v.14 . “Like the door turns on its hinges, so does the sluggard on his bed.” Think about the metaphor employed. A door may be opened and shut a hundred times a day, but never goes anywhere! Of course, the application made of the image is that of a sluggard turning in his bed , but never getting out of it. However, think further. Spiritual sluggards may give the appearance of a lot of activity, but in reality, they never make any real progress. And as a result, they remain spiritual infants (who never get up, grow, mature, learn to walk, run, and work for the Lord), 1Corinthians 3:1-3  à  9:24-27 .  3) The sluggard  starves because he ‘wearies’ of feeding himself,   v.15 . He “buries his hand in the dish; he is weary of bringing it to his mouth again.” Here is one who evidently, and likely through no effort on his part, has ample nutrition before him, but is too lazy to even feed himself! I fear this hits too close to home for many spiritual sluggards in regard to feeding themselves from the milk and meat of the Word of God. They are willing to eat if the preacher or bible class teacher will “spoon-feed” them, but rarely feed themselves by studying on their own, and may even complain and not eat if what they are “spoon-fed” is too hot, cold, much, little , or etc. etc. etc. Thus, they starve to spiritual death because they are too lazy to even feed themselves, despite the ample availability of nutrition, cf. Hebrew 5:11 – 6:8 .  4) The sluggard  thinks he knows it all,   v.16 , he “is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who can give a discreet answer.” Though he imagines all possible obstacles to progress, goes nowhere himself because he can never seem to get up and get going, and starves himself because he is too lazy to avail himself of available nutrition, he still knows more about everything than everyone!  James implies that we should be wary of those who tell us how smart they are, cf. 1:19,26; 2:3ff,12,14,16,18; 3:1-12 , rather than simply demonstrating true wisdom through their actions, cf.1:27; 2:15-17,20-26; 3:13 .  As we begin a new year, let’s make sure to include (and follow through on) the spiritual resolution to abandon spiritual laziness and truly “abound in the work of the Lord,”  1Corinthians 15:58 !","I’ve become old enough, cranky enough, and arthritic enough that purchases having anything to do with my person now must have the “ahhh” factor. If I am going to sit in it, lie on it, wear it, use it, or it’s going to otherwise be in direct contact with me, it must have the “ahhh” factor. For example, not too long ago, I decided that I needed a new office chair. I didn’t necessarily dislike the chair I’d had for several years. I bought it when I was having a lot of lower back problems, and it was very supportive. But it didn’t have the “ahhh” factor that had become important to me. So, I took off to Tyler one morning on a quest to find a new chair.  I went straight to a big office supply store, and they had a cornucopia of chair choices. They had chairs that looked old, they had chairs that looked new, they had chairs that they apparently stocked to supply the local mad scientists’ needs for torture devices in their labs (which I didn’t even know Tyler had!), and they had chairs that looked like that if you accidentally to pulled the wrong lever or pushed the right button, they might sprout rocket propulsion jets and blast off into space. I tried them all, but some of them for no longer than it took my posterior to hit bottom and spring right back up again accompanied by, “Oh no- that’ll never do.” Then it happened, I plopped down in one leather-clad big and tall “executive” chair, and was immediately and absolutely compelled to utter a long and audible “Ahhh.” It was an unstoppable involuntary bodily function, no more controllable than a sneeze during a bishop’s prayer. That’s the way the “Ahhh” factor is though- when it is finally achieved or found, vocalization is mandatory.  The “Ahhh” factor is somewhat hard to define. You may not be able to completely understand or describe it, until you experience it. I didn’t really know exactly what I needed or wanted until I sat in the chair that forced the “Ahhh” out of me. It was adjustable to reach the perfect height, its back curved at just the right place to match my back, the armrests were at the perfect height (which eliminated most of the previous candidates), and the memory foam padding was, as Goldilocks would say, “just right.” I didn’t begin my quest with this particular criterion in mind, I just knew my current chair wasn’t all it could or should be. But, when I found one that was, it became obvious.  What has all of this to do with spiritual matters? Anthropology tells us that cultures all over the world and throughout man’s history have worshipped some form of “god.” Why? God created man with an innate knowledge of a “higher power,” and a need to worship “it.” Without knowledge of inspired revelation ( cf. John 1:18; Hebrews 1:3 ), the form of these “gods” and expression of worship varied, and still varies, greatly. But the knowledge and need is there, unless it is suppressed.  Thus, men have searched “  that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us,”  Acts 17:27 . This search, when divine revelation is ignored, is vain and unsatisfying. Oh, we can know that God exists from simply observing the world around us, or even contemplating the presence and wonders of our own bodies, Romans 1:19-20 ; but the “Ahhh” factor of really understanding God and having a real relationship with Him requires the knowledge and application of His revealed word. Hear Romans 10:2-3 regarding Israel on this point, “ For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge. For not knowing about God’s righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.”   Simply put: Unless we are willing to read God’s revealed word, and do what it requires of us, our lives and the conduct of them will never have the “Ahhh” factor. There will always be something missing, though we may not even be sure exactly what it is. Jesus said, “Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven,”  John 3:5 . The Spirit reveals that water baptism is a necessary part of being “born again.” But notice also v.3 , “Unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of heaven.” Unless we read God’s revealed word, and do what it says, “the kingdom of heaven” specifically, and spiritual matters generally, will elude our comprehension, and we will never have the “Ahhh” factor of truly knowing God.","H. Osby Weaver (I just realized I don’t remember what the “H.” stood for!) was a preacher friend of mine way back when. He and his lovely wife, Mary Helen, were forty-two domino playing partners with Donna and me. Such was somewhat of an odd pairing, since they were among the oldest couples in the congregation, and Donna and I were among, if not the , youngest couple in the group there in Nacogdoches. But no matter, we were good friends. Osby was the preacher for the church there at the time, and I was just starting to preach regularly.  Though I didn’t especially care for Bro. Osby’s manner of presentation- he was very dry and somewhat monotone when speaking publicly, I loved his knowledge of the sacred text, and greatly appreciated his wisdom in the application of it. He was among the first to encourage me to preach “full-time.” Though his sermons weren’t my favorites, I learned a lot from him nonetheless. But in more private settings, like around the domino table, Osby had a great wit and keen sense of humor. Every once in a while, both would break through that serious façade of his to make a great point of application from the Truth.  Once Osby was being questioned, or perhaps challenged (and he usually didn’t appreciate or deal particularly well with either) by a young college student who apparently thought pretty highly of his own opinions and judgments- even in comparison to those of the venerable old servant of the cross. This young man was trying to defend attending “R-rated” movies because, as he put it, “They almost always contain at least one good life lesson.” The unflappable wise one simply replied, \" You might also find one good biscuit at the city dump, but the city dump is a bad place to look for good biscuits.\" You’ve just got to love logic and reason like that! The young man got the point, whether or not he took it to heart is another matter entirely.  What Bro. Weaver so eloquently and succinctly stated was the same, in essence, as the principle stated by inspiration in a couple of places. James 4:4 reads, “You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.” And, 2Corinthians 6:14 adds, “…what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?” What both of these texts are emphasizing is the point the young man was trying avoid: God expects those who would be godly to separate themselves from ungodliness. There are just some activities in which a Christian ought not participate, and should not desire to do so. We can try to justify or excuse our involvement any way we choose, but the truth remains steadfast: “The city dump is just a bad place to look for good biscuits!”  Bro. Osby wasn’t trying to legislate what was “right” and “wrong” for this young man by creating and maintaining an arbitrary set of rules- and neither am I. But, if we really want to be godly and live lives of holiness, barraging our senses with ungodly and unholy sights and sounds isn’t going to help, cf. Roman 13:14 . The real problem this young man faced is one with which we all must deal. It is the inner conflict between wanting to belong to and be saved by God, and still yet wanting to be like and to be liked by the world. Perhaps Jesus said it best, “No one can serve two masters…”,  Matthew 6:24 . We must choose which it will be for us- it simply cannot be both godliness and worldliness, cf. 1John 1:6; 3:7-10 .  Are you looking for “good biscuits in the city dump”? Though you might occasionally find one there, the city dump “is a bad place to look for good biscuits!”","Do you remember the prayer little children used to be taught to recite at bedtime? “Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep; if I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. God bless…(insert a list typically beginning with Mommy and Daddy and proceeding through siblings, grandparents, friends, and winding up with Snowball the cat or Freddy the frog)”. Think about this little prayer for moment. Is the thought of “dying before I wake” really the one you want your child to have before you try to get them to sleep? Good luck with that!  However, from a more adult perspective, there are some very good “grown-up” considerations that can be gleaned from this well meaning but perhaps ill-conceived “child’s” prayer.   The prayer recognizes the brevity of this life. Scripture certainly teaches this lesson: James 4:13-14 , “Come now, you who say, ‘Today or tomorrow, we shall go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.’ Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.” Most of us have had all-too-vivid reminders of this lesson. A family member or close friend is here one day, and everything seems fine- then suddenly, he’s gone. The transient nature of life has examples all around us, and yet some of us never really learn the lesson. What’s the lesson? Each day could be  my  last upon the earth, and each night when  I  pillow  my  head,  I  really could “die before  I  wake”!  While it may not be the best thing to burden a four-year old with such thoughts (let them think about God blessing relatives and pets- even the slimy ones), this is a great lesson for us bigger folks. We need to be reminded that life is short, and that each day or night could be our last. However, the more important question is this: Are we OK with this day or night being our last, if it should turn out that way?  A lot of people give lip serviceto the notion of “living each day as if it could be your last.” And that’s OK, I suppose. But until we are really OK with dying “today,” such is just lip service, or a poor excuse for selfishly pursuing our own desires to the exclusion of responsibilities. This leads us to the other “big person” consideration from this little prayer.   The prayer emphasizes trusting God. The potentially sleep-depriving “If I die before I wake” is offset somewhat by “I pray the Lord my soul to take.” Though we might question the age-appropriateness of the lesson for a child, the point is “spot on” for grown-ups! When we hesitate or equivocate at the question, “Are you ready to die  today  ?” (in spiritual terms, of course), it is usually due to one of two reasons: 1) We know we are not ready, and thus “our heart condemns us,”  1John 3:18-21 ; or, 2) We don’t really trust God. Our head knows all the right things to think (and say) about our own mortality, but our heart still doubts because we do not fully trust Him. Let me illustrate.  One of the great blessings of Stage 4 T-Cell Lymphoma was that of being forced to face mortality up close and personal. Getting to the point of truly being OK with dying “today” was a big step. But looking at a young wife and two young sons knowing that my God and my family (spiritual and physical) would take care of them if today were “the time of my departure” ( 2Timothy 4:6 ) was liberating. It was also important developmentally because it required a level of trust I probably would not have otherwise achieved. I hope you can achieve that trust without cancer and chemo!  Whether you recited that “little” prayer or not, have you learned the “big” lessons of recognizing and accepting the brevity of this life, and truly trusting God with not only your eternal destiny, but with the care of those left behind?","When I was just a toddler, our family attended the old Church of Christ on the corner of Mound Street and Starr Avenue in Nacogdoches. For decades, toddlers went to what was commonly referred to as “Little Class” with Sister Ruby Johnson . “Mrs. Ruby,” as the children all knew her, had a special love for and way with the youngest of the church’s bible class students. I know she had many second-generation students, and may have even had some third-generation ones also. She has such a wonderful spiritual legacy of young lives positively influenced for the cause of Christ. To this day, when I visit that congregation (now “Stallings Drive”), Mrs. Ruby still gets a big hug every time!  One of the songs we sang in Mrs. Ruby’s Little Class was “Oh Be Careful Little Eyes.” It went something like, “Oh be careful little  eyes  what you  see  , for the Father up above is looking down in love, oh be careful little  eyes  what you  see  .” The second and third verses repeated with “ears/hear” and “mouth/say” inserted for “eyes/see.” Of course, there were hand gestures that coincided with the words also. It was, and is, a wonderful diminutive ditty for the pint-sized, but contains a magnificent mantra for the man-sized too!  Self-control is one of the so-called “Christian graces” of 2Peter 1:6 , and is also part of the “fruit of the Spirit” highlighted in Galatians 5:23 . It is what “Oh Be Careful Little Eyes” is really all about. The term “self-control” is self-explanatory, and needs no definitions from Greek or English for us to comprehend. Understanding “self-control” is obviously not the difficult part- implementing it is another matter! But that little song has it right: if we can just control our eyes, ears, and mouths, the rest pretty much follows.  Think about the importance of self-control with regard to our eyes- what we see . Jesus said that “The lamp of the body is the eye; if therefore your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light,”  Matthew 6:22-23 . He also said the inverse is true, “But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness.” It’s no wonder that Job declared, “I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I gaze at a virgin?” ( Job 31:1 ) Job evidently understood the warning verbalized by Jesus much later in Matthew 5:28 that “everyone who looks on a woman to lust for her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.” To understand the full ramifications of Jesus’ words, also consider 1Corinthians 6:9 and Hebrews 13:4 , which both indicate that those guilty of such will miss heaven. “Oh be careful little (and big) eyes what you see”- Matthew 13:13-17 !  Self-control, or the lack of it, also manifests itself with regard to our ears- what we hear . Certainly, one cannot always control that which is seen or heard, but such inadvertent or accidental “hearing” or “seeing” is not really the point. King David likely “accidently” first saw Bathsheba bathing herself, but this wasn’t the real problem. His continual looking, inquiring after her, and sending for her became the problem(s)! So too it is with hearing: it is not the unintentional hearing of something that we shouldn’t that typically gets us into to trouble. Instead, it is the deliberate listening to gossip ( 1Timothy 5:13 ), the filth of dirty jokes and entertainment ( Ephesians 5:3-4 ), and other things to which a child of God has no business listening to that causes problems. “Oh be careful little (and big) ears what you hear”- Romans 10:17 !  Perhaps nowhere is self-control more difficult, or more needed, than in regard to our tongues- what we say.  James has much to say about both the power and danger of the tongue: “But no one can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil and full of deadly poison,”  James 3:8ff . Self-control in regard to the tongue sounds hopeless. However, it is important to realize that James is not saying the tongue is uncontrollable. He writes of the inability to “tame” it. “Taming” something implies that it can be trusted to do what one wants without constraint or compulsion. In this sense, our tongues can never be fully trusted and tamed. We must always maintain a “tight rein” on the tongue to “make” (rather than trust) it to behave. You know this already- as soon as you “loosen the reins” on your own tongue, the betrayal inevitably occurs. “Oh be careful little (and big) mouths what you say”- Matthew 12:36 !  It seems this “little class” song surely has some “big” meanings!","I’m almost always in favor of New Testament baptism, which means: the right precept  (or teaching, one can’t be taught ‘wrong’ and baptized ‘right,’ Titus 3:5 ); the right person  (a penitent believer, Acts 2:37-38 ); the right procedure  (immersion in water, Colossians 2:12 ); and the right purpose  (to “wash away sins,”  Acts 22:16 ). But, I am against baptism if/when the candidate says he was saved at the point of faith, and then wants to be baptized because “It’s the ‘right’ thing to do.” In this scenario, it is absolutely the ‘wrong’ thing to do, but perhaps not for the reason(s) you suspect….  In regard to salvation, the New Testament uses the term “dead” in at least a couple of ways. For instance, Ephesians 2:1-2 says, “you were dead   in trespasses and sins , in which you formerly walked…”. But, Romans 6:2-7 also describes becoming  “dead to sin”  that we might “walk in newness of life” by being united with Christ “in the likeness of His resurrection.” Obviously, there is a huge difference between being dead  “in”  sin, and being dead  “to”  sin! The first implies slavery through sin, and yields spiritual condemnation; while the second intimates emancipation from sin, and results in spiritual salvation. Let’s look further at this second scenario of becoming “dead to sin” from Romans 6 .  There are some important aspects of becoming “dead to sin” and “alive to Christ” that we need to consider relative to baptism. In v.2 , the divine record says that those “who died to sin” shouldn’t “still live in it.” This means that the “saved” person must “crucify his old self” and no longer bea “slave to sin,”  cf. vv.6-11 . Baptism is linked to this process in vv.3-4 . How so?   Romans 6:3 says that baptism is the means by which we contact Christ’s death, “Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into  His  death.” Why is this crucial? Christ’s blood was shed in His death, and we need to contact the blood of Christ for salvation, Ephesians 1:7 . Baptism, then, puts us in contact with the redeeming power of Christ’s shed blood by which we are saved.   Romans 6:4 adds that we are “buried with Him through baptism into death…”. There are two important points I’d like to make from this. The first one is obvious: baptism is a burial. We are immersed in water as Jesus was immersed in the earth . No one is “buried” by sprinkling or pouring a little dirt on them and calling it a “burial.” Jesus was “in” the earth, and to be scripturally baptized after this figure, one must be “in” (covered by) water.  The second point from Romans 6:4 may not be so obvious, but is nonetheless critical to our proper understanding: baptism is “into death”. Notice that Jesus’ death, mentioned in v.3 , is not specified in v.4 . This is because baptism includes both our access to Jesus’ death (and therefore, His blood ), as well as being the mechanism that marks the “end” of our life of sin and slavery to it. In other words, we not only “put to death” our “old man of sin,” we “bury” him because he’s dead to us, cf. v.11 !  Now think this through carefully:  If  we become spiritually “alive” (saved) at the point of faith, and thus prior to baptism, we should never be baptized. Why? Because you don’t bury “live” folks- you bury “dead” folks! And as my old preacher-friend Brother Floyd Offing once said on this point, “It’s against the law to bury ‘live’ folks just about everywhere!” (He had a remarkable way with words!) Baptism is a “burial,” and you just don’t bury people that are “alive”- either physically or spiritually. You bury the “dead”- physically, but also spiritually. The physically dead are buried to await the great and final resurrection, cf. 1Corinthians 15:12-58 . The spiritually dead (to sin) are buried “in order that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life,”   Romans 6:4b .  The New Testament indeed teaches that we “saved by faith,”  Ephesians 2:8-9 . It nowhere teaches that we are saved “by faith alone .” In fact, the only text in which the words “faith” and “alone” appear together is in James 2:24 , “You see that a man is justified by works, and  not by faith alone.”  I want everyone to be baptized- but based on the scriptural teaching, in the scriptural way, and for the scriptural reasons.","When it comes to watching television, I watch mostly sports, old movies, and some science or nature programing- but sports probably gets the lion’s share of my TV-viewing time. This is probably because I enjoyed playing sports as a youngster. The school I attended growing up was too small (and poor!) for football, but I played just about everything else that was offered. Thus, basketball and baseball were mainstays. Nonetheless, I enjoy watching baseball, basketball, and football (especially college).  There is, however, one thing that really frustrates me (besides commercials, which I avoid like the plague!): why do athletes at seemingly every level now feel the need to  taunt  the opposition? Back when sports were supposed to teach something besides “winning” and “making more money,” sportsmanship, teamwork, integrity, respect, and fair-play were lessons that were always emphasized in and through the games and practices. And so, the image of a safety standing over a downed receiver after a “big hit,” or power forward mouthing off and gesturing to one on whom he has just “dunked,” or a tailback or wide-out doing some sort of “touchdown dance celebration,” is just plain repulsive. These things are all about self-aggrandizement, and undermine the very definition of the word “sportsmanship.” At least some seem to agree, since this kind of behavior occasionally draws a penalty or technical foul.  Glorying in the defeat of an enemy, which is really what “taunting” is all about, is not just repulsive to me, it is distasteful to God. Job understood this. Consider his words recorded in Job 31:29-30 , “Have I rejoiced at the extinction of my enemy, or exulted when evil befell him? No, I have not allowed my mouth to sin… ” Job seems to comprehend that God does not delight in the demise of the ungodly ( cf. Ezekiel 18:23,32 ), and that neither should we rejoice in the humbling, or catastrophic demise of our enemies. Jonah, however, did not get this point.  God had sent Jonah to preach to Nineveh, the great city of the Assyrians. The Assyrians were fierce and brutal people whom Jonah considered to be an, if not the, enemy. And yet, God knew the Assyrians also had souls which needed saving, cf. John 4:10-11 . So, Jonah was sent to preach to them- but he didn’t want to, and tried to flee to avoid it. Even after he was “convinced” (by a God-sent storm and great fish) to preach to the Ninevites, and they responded in repentance and obedience, Jonah still wasn’t happy. In fact, he was just plain mad about it, cf. Jonah 4:1ff . He even went outside of the city, built himself a shelter, and sat down under it to wait “until he could see what would happen in the city,”  4:5b . He was still hoping God would destroy them after all, and then he could “taunt” (rejoice over the demise of) his perceived enemies!  There are some athletes, certainly in the minority, who congratulate their opponent on a good tackle, or a nice shot, or a great play, and then line up and go again. They seem to understand that it is, after all, only a game, and that there are “bigger” issues at stake than personal glory or success. What refreshing sportsmanship, and I applaud them for their attitude and conduct! But I can’t help but wonder, when the “wrong” lessons are instead being learned and exhibited in sports, if they are influencing our cultural mindset with regard to how we treat perceived enemies and opponents? After all, sports are just sports (or at least are supposed to be), but life is life. If we can’t figure out how to properly treat one another when we “play,” how will we possibly do so in real-world, real-life situations? Are we really that different from old Jonah?  Jesus crystalized this required godly attitude in Matthew 5:44 , “love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.” If we have a real enemy (besides Satan, cf. Ephesians 6:11-12 ), or even a perceived one, wouldn’t Jesus’ words require us to at least treat them with respect, and genuinely desire “good” for them? And if we do this, are they really still an “enemy”- at least from our perspective? If we can’t love and treat well those who don’t love and treat us well, we can’t be children of God, Matthew 5:45-48 . Obviously, these things are much more important than “good sportsmanship” in an athletic contest, but, if you can’t enjoy the game without abusing and debasing your opponent, please take up Solitaire!","Everything is in a name, if that name is “Jesus Christ” ! Why? Consider Acts 4:12 , “And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men, by which we must be saved.” Think about some of the implications of this passage…  When the Holy Spirit inspired (which literally means “God-breathed,” see v.8 ) Peter to say there was “no other name…by which we must be saved,” please realize all the names this eliminates from being able to produce salvation.  It eliminates the name “Abraham” - thus Jews could no longer rely on physical ancestry to Him for their salvation. John made this clear from the beginning of his ministry in Luke 3:8 , “Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father,’ for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham.” To be saved eternally, Israelites must obey Jesus.  It also eliminates the name “Mohammed” from being able to procure eternal salvation. Whatever good this man accomplished, or whatever good is accomplished in or through his name, the pardoning of sins is not among those accomplishments.  It also eliminates the name “ Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi” (aka “Mahatma Gandhi”) from being able to save souls from eternal damnation. There is no doubt or debate that this man did a tremendous amount for Hindus and Muslims in India and South Africa, and for all men in a sense. But, all the good that he accomplished was for this life, for no soul is saved in the name of “Gandhi.”  It also eliminates the name “Confucius” (“Kong Qiu”) from being able to provide eternal security. Confucius lived between 551 and 479 B.C. His philosophy championed strong family loyalty- even to the point of ancestor worship, and eminent respect of children for their parents and wives for their husbands. He is perhaps the most oft-quoted philosopher of all time, and no doubt had many good and morally profitable teachings, but did not and cannot “save” anyone.  It also eliminates the name “Rasputin” (Grigori Yefimovech Rasputin, 1860-1916), the Russian Orthodox Christian “mystic” philosopher. He was thought by some to have greatly influenced the Russian Emperor (Nicholas II) and his wife and son (Alexei), and therefore nation, as a physic and faith healer. Others consider(ed) him to be a religious charlatan. Whatever the opinion of his talents and abilities, they did not include the salvation of men’s souls!  It also eliminates the name “Nietzsche” (Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, 1844-1900) the German philosopher famous for “the death of God” argument; and the name “Nostradamus” (Michel de Nostredame, 1503-1566), the French pharmacist (then called “apothecary”) who published volumes of prophecies which some claim predicted many modern events. However popular or unpopular these philosophers and “prophets” may have been in their times, or in ours, does not make their names powerful enough to produce the salvation of men’s souls. The same can obviously be said for any philosopher, scientist, or proclaimed “prophet” save “the Prophet” ( cf. Deuteronomy 18:15,18 ; John 6:14 ), Jesus Christ.  But, this also eliminates “Joseph Smith” (the proclaimed “prophet” of The Book of Mormon), “Mary Baker Eddy” (the prophet and founder of the Christian Scientist), “L. Ron Hubbard” (Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, the “prophet” and founder of the Church of Scientology and Dianetics), “Martin Luther” (from which the Lutherans derive their name), “John Calvin” (who put forth the doctrines of predestination which became “Calvinism”), “John Wesley” and “Charles Wesley” (Anglican clerics whose foundational doctrines came to be Wesleyanism), “Charles Spurgeon” (aka “The Prince of Preachers,” 1834-1892), and “Thomas Campbell” or “Alexander Campbell” (this son and father, who, along with others such as Barton W. Stone, sought to “restore” the church back to the N.T. pattern, rather than to simply “reform” it). None of these names, whatever their contributions to or detractions from the gospel, are “the name” through which salvation comes! Why?  It’s actually very simple. None of them died on the cross and was raised from the dead, Acts 4:10 ! And, none of them became “the very Corner Stone” of our salvation and association with God in the Church, Acts 4:11 . Therefore, being baptized in their name(s) accomplishes nothing, Matthew 28:19 ; “observing all” that they command likewise does not produce salvation, Matthew 28:20 ; and, their words are not those by which all will be judged, John 12:48 . Don’t follow any man, follow “ the man, Christ Jesus , who gave Himself as a ransom for all,”  1Timothy 2:5-6 .","In Acts 2 , when Peter and the rest of the apostles sought to convince the audience on Pentecost that Jesus was “both Lord and Christ- this Jesus whom you crucified” ( v.36 ), they began by saying that He was  “attested,”   v.22 .  “Attested” is an interesting word. It is translated from a compound Greek word, apodieknumi, which is derived from apo (apart), and deiknuo (to show or give evidence). Thus, it basically means, “to point out.” Here it is being used to indicate that Jesus had been  demonstrated  or  proven   . How? Notice the rest of v.22 , “a man attested to you by God with miracles , and wonders , and signs which God performed through Him in your midst, just as you yourselves know…”   For the purposes of this article, I’m not as interested in how Jesus was shown to be divine as much as that He was shown to be divine. The  miracles  (power),  wonders  (awe-producing), and  signs  (evidence of supernatural cause)  attested  (proved/demonstrated) that Jesus was both  Lord  (Master) and  Christ  (Savior).  The attesting power of Jesus’ miracles was even admitted by the Jewish leaders after He healed the man born blind ( John 9 ), and raised Lazarus ( John 11 ), “What are we doing? For this man is performing many signs,”  John 11:47 . They could not deny the power of Jesus, so they sought to get rid of Him. “So from that day on they planned together to kill Him,”  v.53 . Eventually, of course, they succeeded in getting the Romans to crucify Him, despite their own admission of His divine power! However, let’s take this a bit further.  In the process of the Jewish leadership procuring the death of Jesus at the hands of the Roman government, Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, sought to dissuade their desires by instead offering them a “notorious prisoner, Barabbas” ( Matthew 27:16 ). It was customary for the ruling governor to release any prisoner his subjects desired at the time of the Feast ( cf. Matthew 27:15 ). Think about this. Barabbas is said to be “notorious”- which means that he was notably infamous. He was a well-known insurrectionist and murderer, Mark 15:7 , and as such, deserved to die. Apparently, Pilate thought that, given the choice between such a  notable  murderer and menace to society, and one  known  to have performed miraculous acts of healing, they would surely choose Jesus. But he was wrong, for they instead shouted, “Away with this man, and release for us Barabbas!” ( Luke 23:18 ).  Here’s the point: Both Barabbas and Jesus were  attested !  Both had been demonstrated and proven - one to be a murderer, and One who “went about doing good, and healing all who were oppressed by the devil; for God was with Him,”  Acts 10:38b . And yet, as Peter would later point out to the Jews in Acts 3:14-15 , “you disowned the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted you, but put to death the Prince of life…” One took life, and one gave life- even by raising the dead to life, physically and spiritually . But alas, the evil was chosen over the good, despite the fact that both were well known, and their true natures were well attested!   This really shouldn’t surprise us, nor should we be too condemning of their choice. After all, do not we do the same thing when we knowingly choose evil over good in our lives? The differences between the two are well attested, “Little children, let no one deceive you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; the one who practices sin is of the devil…”  1John 3:7-8 . And yet, we, like those who chose Barabbas over Jesus despite their attested natures, often love “ the darkness rather than the light,”  John 3:19 .","Pigpens are nasty, stinky, muck-filled, cesspools. I know- I’ve been there. My grandfather raised hogs for various major pork companies, the names of which you could read on your breakfast sausage package. As a little boy, I remember clamoring over a seemingly endless maze of fences in an effort to keep up with him as he fed and watered literally hundreds of hogs- which, by the way, don’t smell any better in large numbers.  Later, as a high-school student, I raised registered hogs, and sold full-blood and full-blood crosses for breeding stock (the full-blood ones stink too!). And thus, I had pigpens of my own to smell and wade through. Though baby pigs are about the cutest, softest, and funniest critters you can imagine, they soon become “hogs” with all of the implied nastiness of the term fully intended. They aren’t just called “hogs” because of their appetites, you know! (Did I mention they smell bad too?)  So, why would anyone need to be thankful for such a putrid place as a pigpen? That’s easy, though I detest the smell of live swine, I love the smell of dead pork- especially over an open flame! If I could only have one kind of meat to eat for the rest of my life, with no hesitation at all I’d choose pork. I love bacon, I love sausage, I love ham, I love pork chops, I love pork ribs, I love pork tenderloin, I love pork tamales, I even love fired pork rinds! However, I draw the line at pig’s feet- preferring instead to do my eatin’  a little ‘higher’ on the hog! So, as malodorous as they are, I’m thankful for pigpens, for without them I’d have no pork to eat- and that would be, for me at least, a true tragedy! But, there’s another significant reason we should all be thankful for pigpens….  It usually takes the putridity of “pigpen” in our lives to make us realize the depth of depravity and despair to which we have sunk. In this regard, we are often like the prodigal son of Luke 15 . This young man arrogantly demanded his inheritance before the customary time, then quickly departed to a distant land and “devoured your (the father’s) wealth with harlots,” at least according to his older brother, v.30 . But think about it:  When  and  where  was it that this young man “came to his senses,”  v.17 ? It wasn’t when he was demanding and receiving the wealth of his father, v.12 . It wasn’t when he was out on his own, perhaps for the first time in his life, and traveling to a far country, v.13a . It wasn’t when he was enjoying the “high life” of “loose living,”  v.13b .It wasn’t even when “he began to be in need,”  v.14 . None of these did the trick, but the “pigpen” did it! The stench, filth, and degradation of the pigpen was the “rock bottom” this young Jewish man had to hit to jar some sense back into him, cf. vv.16-19 .  However, don’t overlook an important part of a sentence that we often read through without really considering. The latter part of v.16 states, “and no one was giving anything to him.” Suppose someone had given him something. Do you suppose he would have “come to his senses” then? It may be merely conjecture, and especially so since this is a made-up story in the first place, but I’m betting that if it hadn’t been for “the pigpen,” his spiritual awakening would have never occurred. How can I be so sure? It’s human nature to some degree. As long as we “have all the answers” and everything we think we need, we’re pretty independent… and arrogant. But, when we have nowhere else to turn, and have exhausted all “our” resources (and sinful pride!), and wake up in some “pigpen” of our own making,  then  we humbly recognize our dependence on our Father.  Unfortunately, it often takes the complete abasement of a putrid “pigpen” to purify us. So, if a “pigpen” is what is required to get you to a spiritual awakening of your dependence upon God, and your need of the cleansing only Jesus can offer ( Acts 22:16 ), be thankful for that “pigpen”!","If you remember these two bible characters, you’re doing much better at your studies than I am at mine (and please remind me to never play Bible Trivia with you)! As far as I can find, they are mentioned only once, and even then not much more than their names are given- except for one significant detail. The text of Acts 17:34 indicates that, at hearing the gospel preached by Paul at Athens, they “joined him and believed…”   Although the verse also indicates that there were others who likewise accepted the gospel’s invitation and obeyed, these two are mentioned by name. What a legacy!  After Paul had fled from the Jews of Thessalonica who had pursued him to Berea, he waited for Timothy and Silas in Athens. This was a unique place. The city was filled with philosophers and self-proclaimed thinkers, cf. Acts 17:18,20-21 . These folks prided themselves as being “on the cutting edge” of modern conceptual thought. Such obviously did not deter Paul. When given the opportunity to speak, he used their own superstitious and philosophical natures to teach them about the one true God, and the salvation He affords all men through Jesus Christ.  However, for our purposes, let’s concentrate more upon the reactions than the message this time. There were three distinction reactions to Paul’s sermon, which also parallel reactions to the gospel today. Let’s notice them.   Some sneered at the gospel,  “Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some began to sneer…”  Acts 17:32a . Evidently, their own “wisdom” ( cf. 1Cor.1:18ff ) was not offended when Paul showed the folly of their ignorant idolatry to an “Unknown God,”  vv.22-27 ; or his explanation of the true nature of God, vv.28-29 ; or even his pressing of their need of repentance in preparation for a coming judgment, vv.30-31 ; but could not stand his suggestion of a hope beyond death through resurrection, vv.31-32 ! The arrogant pride of their own conclusions caused them to sneer at anything other than a completely carnal view of life- that death was the complete cessation of all life and all hope. What a miserable view, and way to live! Paul told the Corinthians that those who hoped in this life only were “of all men most to be pitied,”  1Corinthians 15:19 . These sneering Athenians were far too smart to believe such a message of hope and salvation!   Some delayed at the preaching of the gospel, saying, “We shall hear you again concerning this,”  Acts 17:32b . Perhaps they were not yet completely convinced. Perhaps they liked and even believed what they heard, but were not yet fully ready to commit to the changes the gospel required. Perhaps they were just putting Paul off to avoid having to make a decision. Sadly, the divine record does not expound on their motives for delaying- just that they did. But it does say, in the next verse, that “Paul went out of their midst,” ( v.33 ); and then unfortunately adds that “After these things he left Athens and went to Corinth,”  Acts 18:1 . The point is that there is no indication in the text that these delayers in Athens, whatever their reason for hesitation, ever had another opportunity to hear the gospel…or to obey and be saved by it. The Roman governor Felix had a similar reaction to the truth, “Go away for the present, and when I find time, I will summon you, “  Acts 24:25 . Again, there is no mention in the text of that next time ever coming. The truth of Isaiah 55:6 rings clearly, “Seek the Lord while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near.” Indeed, there is great danger in delay. A man I know pretty well says, “Conclusions have consequences, so does indecision.”   Some also believed,   “But some men joined him and believed, among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them,”  Acts 17:34 . The word “join” is translated from the Greek term kallao, which literally means, “to glue, to glue together, cement, fasten together,” ( Enhanced Strong’s Lexicon ). The idea is that these people, once presented with the gospel of salvation by Paul, clung to him and would not let go. They stayed with him until they heard sufficient teaching to believe and obey the gospel. This is a remarkable contrast to the disinterested disdain of some, and the dispassionate delay of others in Athens.  The question that remains is this: How are you reacting to the Gospel? Will you be numbered and named with Dionysius and Damaris, or counted with the transgressors who sneered and delayed?","Safety switches are everywhere! It may be a subversive plot by the mechanized underworld to take over us! For instance, can’t get your car out of “Park” until you put your foot on the brake? That’s a safety switch added to keep you from backing through the garage door (at least in theory). Can’t get your car to start after backing into a light pole in the parking lot? It’s likely the inertia fuel safety switch in the trunk that shuts off the fuel pump after an accident (it has a button on the top you press to reset it). Your blender won’t blend unless you twist the handle while pressing the button? It’s the safety switch designed to prevent you from being able to turn it on with one hand while the other hand is inside the blender. Your riding lawnmower dies every time you hit a big bump? There’s a safety switch under the seat that is deactivated when your weight is even temporarily or slightly lifted from the seat. It’s supposed to keep you from getting your toes masticated under the mower deck when you hop down to pick up that stick or ball. And on, and on, and on it goes.  Some of the safety switches are good ideas that save lives, limbs, and property; but some of them are, well, just attempts to “idiot-proof” tools that make using them aggravating for the rest of us. (And to prevent lawyers from having too much to do!) Thus, the riding lawnmower I crawled on one day that had four different safety switches on it- putting it in reverse while the cutting blades were engaged would kill the motor, quickly got  “rewired!”  Although it wasn’t mine, after I finished, it “worked” much better.  As frustrating as some of the ridiculous safety switches are, wouldn’t be great to have a few “spiritual safety switches” available to us? For instance, what if we could install some sort of safety switch to our tongues to prevent them from “going in gear” before our brains were “on the brake” to prevent runoff, cf. James 3:1-12 ? That would be helpful! Or, what if we had an inertia safety switch to keep us from going on from one “wreck” in our lives to another without taking the time to find and press the “reset” button of wisdom, James 3:13 ; 4:2 ? Such would certainly prevent a lot of spiritual disasters! Certainly we could all use a safety switch to keep us from having our “hands” in dangerous spiritual situations, 1Thessalonians 4:11 . And, who couldn’t benefit from a safety switch to protect our “toes” from the repercussions of our own careless thoughts, words, and deeds, Matthew 18:8 ; 1Corinthians 12:15 ? Yep, “spiritual safety switches” would be a lot more helpful, and a lot less aggravating, than many of the physical ones we encounter every day!  The good news is that these “spiritual safety switches” have already been invented, are readily available, and are already in use in some (models of) people. What are these “spiritual safety switches” ? Please consider the following.  The Word of God is a “spiritual safety switch.” When properly installed (in the heart, James 1:21 ), it provides us “all things that pertain to life and godliness,”  2Peter 1:3 . This doesn’t mean God will tell us what make or color of car to buy- instead, through the New Testament, He tells us how to live in holiness so as to please Him. But please understand an important principle: God’s laws, contained for us in His Word, are for our good both here and now, as well as hereafter. The Father doesn’t give us the Bible to restrict us, or to make us miserable in life, but that we might have life abundantly,  cf. John 10:10b . What this means is that living obediently to the Word of God will help us to avoid many of the “wrecks” of life.   Prayer is also a “spiritual safety switch.” When you are tempted to do something wrong, what do you suppose would happen if you just pulled the “emergency safety switch” by stopping to pray first? If you sincerely asked the Creator to help you have the strength to do the right thing, or asked for help in knowing what the right thing to do was, do you suppose He would ignore that request? I don’t think so, James 1:2-8 !   Fellowship with Christians is also a “spiritual safety switch.” Think about it: Do you get your “hands” in the wrong places (by doing things you shouldn’t) when you are around other Christians, or when you are in the company of worldly people? Obviously, it is easier to “do right” when you are around and associated with other people who are doing right. But, the inverse is also obviously true, 1Corinthians 15:33 , “Bad company corrupts good morals.”   See? Safety switches aren’t always aggravating and unnecessary!","Since everyone has sinned ( Romans 3:23 ), and even those committed to Christ continue to sin to some degree ( 1John 1:8 ), repentance is pretty much a constant need. On the simplest level, “repentance” is “change.” In Matthew 3:2 , John the Baptist told his audiences to “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” He was telling them they needed to change.  A little more specifically, repentance is a change of mind that leads to a change of activity, course, and direction, cf. 2Corinthians 12:21 . Through the process of salvation, repentance also leads one to a change of allegiance . One changes, or switches, “teams” by moving from “the domain of darkness…to the kingdom of His beloved Son,” ( Colossians 1:13 ).  After one is on the Lord’s side, the need for repentance is still present, because sin is not completely eliminated from our lives. Christians do not forget how to sin, and God does not overlook or excuse sin just because the perpetrator belongs to Him, cf. Acts 8:12-13, 20-24 . After all, isn’t wrong still “wrong” even when your child does it? 1John 3:4 indicates that sin is “sin” for everyone. Thus, the need for repentance is an ever-present part of everyone’s life.  Given these things, why don’t we all just repent and do our part to make things right ( Matthew 3:8 ) when we sin? The answer to this one is simple: Repentance is hard. Why? A couple of reasons should be readily apparent: 1) we don’t really like to admit that we’re wrong (which requires a change of mind); and, 2) we don’t really like to amend our lives (which would obviously require a change of activity, course, and direction). So, what do we do instead? We retreat to the “weakness” defense.  The “weakness” defense is claiming that our lack of repentance, evidenced by habitual sin (committing the same sin, or sins, over and over), is due to “weakness” rather than a refusal to repent. There is no doubt that some sins we commit, even repetitively, are due to weakness- either in knowledge or strength, which come with maturity. But if we have been Christians long enough to be meat-eaters ( cf. Hebrews 5:12-14 ), and are still defending our lack of repentance by claiming “weakness,” the problem is likely rebellion instead.  It soon becomes all too easy to attribute our repetitive sins to “weakness,” and make prayerful requests for God to forgive them on that basis, without really making any effort at all to repent. However, we must remember that forgiveness of sins is linked to repentance, instead of perpetual weakness. Consider two passages from Acts on this point: “Repent therefore and return, that your sins may be wiped away, in order that the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,”  3:19 ; and, “Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray the Lord that if possible, the intention of your heart may be forgiven you,”  8:22 .  Is weakness a very real cause of sin? Absolutely. Is it also true that many of us are all too content with feigned “weakness” because we enjoy sin and don’t really want to change (repent)? Positively, and that makes us “rebellious”- not weak, “for there are many rebellious men, empty talkers and deceivers…”  Titus 1:9 .  Repentance isn’t easy, but it is required, Luke 13:3,5 . We can’t keep deceiving ourselves into thinking that perpetual weakness is a pardonable excuse for sin. At some point, we have to own up to the fact that we’re actually rebelling against God through our continued knowledgeable disobedience of His will. We could do better, if we just would . Unfortunately, “I just couldn’t help myself” is a lie we tell ourselves, others, and even God in an effort to absolve our failures to do what we know is right. The truth is that we usually know better, and can do better, but just choose not to  do better, cf. 1Corinthians 10:13 . So, let’s decide to stop hiding behind purported weaknesses, and do the “right” things. Otherwise, we may well be just making a “provision for the flesh in regard to its lust” ( Romans 13:14 ), and that sounds an awful lot like “rebellion!”","Have you ever said, or had said to you, something along the lines of, “I pray for _____ all the time, but never seem to get it.”? Even when the petition is made in the full assurance of faith that God has the ability to grant the request, it often just doesn’t come to fruition for us. In light of the promises made by God in such passages such as Matthew 7:7-11 , why is this? While there may be several answers (such as, I’m asking God to do something for me that I ought to be doing myself, or at least doing my part to achieve, or asking for something that is not according to His will { i.e. what is ultimately right or best}), the short one is “The reason matters.”  “The reason matters” relates not only to the request itself, but also why you/we desire it. For example, do you pray for patience constantly without really sensing any improvement in that area of your life? If so, then perhaps you should back up and ask yourself a searching question: “Why do I want God to give me patience?” If the answer is “So  my  life will be easier” or “less stressful,” or some other selfishly motivated reason, such could be well be the reason that particular request hasn’t been granted. If, on the other hand, the answer was, “So I can be a better servant of God, and more beneficial to others in becoming the same,” do you suppose that such a motivation would garner a different response from the Father?  Note an example of exactly the point I’m trying to make from 1Kings 3 . Solomon was given the opportunity to ask for anything he wanted of God. His decision is manifested in the prayer of vv.6-9 , the crux of which is found in v.9a , “So give Thy servant an understanding heart to judge Thy people to discern between good and evil.” Solomon didn’t ask for wisdom so he could be “the wisest man on the planet”- that would have been selfish. Instead, he: acknowledged the past loving-kindness God had shown his father, David, v.6 ; acknowledged his unworthiness to be king due his youth and inexperience, v.7 ; acknowledged the enormity of the task before him to rule the great people of God, v.8 ; and then asked for the ability to perform God’s will in the best manner possible to carry out the task God had laid before him. In other words, he asked for the ability to serve God and God’s people in a way that would glorify the Father, rather than himself! Now, is that a different premise from which most of your unanswered prayers are formed?  In James 4:1-4 , the Lord’s brother first identifies wrong pleasure sources as being the cause of “quarrels and conflicts among you,”  v.1 . I really don’t think James is addressing, in this verse, conflicts   between     people  as much as conflicts   within     the individual ; which seems to be borne out by the internal sinful motivations of “lust…envy” which produce the outward sins of “murder…fight(ing)…quarrel(ling)” mentioned in v.3 (see also Romans 7:14-23 , where Paul likewise addresses this conflict within ). Additionally, the Greek preposition en, which most all of the major translations render here as “ among you” in v.1 , can just as accurately be translated as “ in you,”- which strengthens the notion of internal rather than external conflict. But, let’s not lose the point: wrong pleasure sources existed, which, in turn, prevented their petitions from being granted by God. Note v.3 specifically on this, “You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives , so that you may spend it on your pleasures”- and their pleasures were, as previously noted, wrongly sourced!  So, if your prayerful requests aren’t being granted, it could be that you are asking: 1) for wrong things , or at least asking for things God knows you don’t need, and/or that aren’t best; or, 2) with wrong motives . If the objects of your requests are selfish, or even selfishly motivated, it seems pretty clear that those requests are going to be denied by the Father. But, if your requests are for the purpose of making you a better servant, and therefore enable you to bring glory to God rather than yourself, well, that’s a completely different matter! Before you pull out “your list” of prayer requests the next time, remember the words of Solomon and James, and the humble and selfless motivations they exemplify.","First, please understand the difference between “preacher” and “pastor,” for although one man can wear both of these hats, the terms are not synonymous. “Preacher” comes from the Greek word  kerusso   , and simply refers to one who functions as a “herald” or “proclaimer”- thus, John the Baptist and Noah were both “preachers,” cf. John 1:6-8 ; 2Peter 2:5 . However, neither of these men were “pastors” as the term is used in the New Testament. “Pastor” is translated from the Greek (Greek was the original language of the New Testament) word  poimen   , and refers generally to “a shepherd.” But, the term is also specifically used of an office in the church which is synonymous with Elders, Overseers, and Bishops (see Acts 20:17,28 where all four terms are used to describe to the same office).  Additionally, there are specific qualifications given for Pastors/Elders/Bishops/Overseers in 1Timothy 3 and Titus 1 that not all “preachers” meet. For instance, though Paul was certainly a preacher ( cf. 1Timothy 2:7 ), he was not a Pastor because, having never been married, he could not meet the qualification of being “the husband of one wife,”  1Timothy 3:2 . With these things out of the way, let’s get to the point.   Preachers and Pastors need  patience . Patience is listed in Galatians 5:22ff as being part of the “fruit of the Spirit” every Christian should possess, but perhaps these two roles of preaching and pastoring require even more than a normal amount. Why is this so? Consider that preaching and pastoring are well-illustrated with two bible examples: 1) raising crops or livestock; and 2) raising children.  Preaching the word is obviously compared to “sowing seed” in Luke 8:5ff and 1Corinthians 3:6-7 ; and Jesus compared His efforts to teach the Word of God to that of a shepherd providing for sheep in Mark 6:34 . If you have any doubt that much patience is needed in these agrarian pursuits, then you’ve never lived that life, and you’re evidently unfamiliar with James 5:7 , “…Behold, the farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it, until it gets the early and the late rains.” Now here’s the point: preaching the word of God and/or pastoring His flock (at least doing them right) requires the same great patience as preparing soil, planting seed, watering and tending the plant as it grows,and continuing to feed and protect it until it matures and bears fruit just like its farming counterpart. And, anyone who has ever raised livestock can tell you of the patience likewise required in that endeavor ( cf. 1Peter 2:25a ).  Preaching and/or pastoring is also compared to having and raising children, cf.1Corinthians 4:15 ; Galatians 4:19 ; 1Timothy 1:2 . It requires the same kind of love, sacrifice, and dedication, as well as lots and lots of patience. Important “life lessons” must be patiently repeated over and over again. Mistakes that are made must be treated with generous amounts of love, compassion, empathy, and patience- since they possibly will be repeated a couple of times before being overcome. Often, we have to try to “be happy while you wait” (which was my wife’s great definition of “patience” she often repeated to our boys when they were little) while those lessons taught in the formative years seem to lay dormant before finally springing forth in the understanding and application of maturity. Undoubtedly, raising “spiritual” children is a lot like raising “physical” children in that both require tremendous amounts of patience! Paul wrote to Timothy on this point, “And the Lord’s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition; if perhaps God will grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth…” ( 2Timothy 2:24-25 )  “So, where does the part about ‘Pews and Parking’ from the title come into play?” Preachers and Pastors who have and manifest the kind and amount of patience the Lord requires of them in their roles may progress into trouble having sufficient “pews” and “parking” to accommodate the people in their congregations (enough “P’s” yet?). But, the inverse is also true: Preachers and Pastors who lack the kind and amount of patience the Lord requires of them in their roles will probably have plenty room in the pews and parking lots of their congregations!"],"title":["Why People Change Spiritually….Or Don’t","Not Speaking Evil of the Dead","Spiritual Math Quiz","Spiritual “Do-Nuts”","Hyphenated People","Walking Together","Hospital Reflective Observations","Distorting the Scriptures","Spiritual Laziness","Finding a Stopping Place","What Will You Give in Exchange for Your Soul?","Why Churches Don’t Grow","Medal, Metal, and Mettle","Practice May Not Make Us Perfect….","How to Keep Yourself Spiritually Immature","How to Keep Yourself Spiritually Illiterate","“I Think I Need A New Shovel”","Playing Mind Games","Hating Evil and Loving Good","Devotion to Spiritual Education in the Home","“What’s YOUR Name?”","Denominational, Inter-Denominational, and Non-Denominational","“My House Shall Be Called a House of P….”","Think, Act, and then Feel","Unity","Patient Faith versus Dead Faith","The Power of God to Save","Is Man Passive or Active in Salvation?","The Futility of Idolatry","Hearing Voices","Trust the Emancipation of Faith","“We just cannot….","“What is Truth?”","Whose Will Will It Be For 2014?","“Common Knowledge” and the Scriptures","Physical and Spiritual Consequences","“Spiritual Children”","College and Church","Thankfulness and Contentment","“Hometown” Pride","God’s Promise of Romans 8:28","Just Imagine","Nets, Boats, Water Pots, Homes, Families, Farms, Etc.","Care and Concern","Trusting the Word","Loving the Word","Love and Trust","Are You 4F, AWOL, MIA, or a POW?","Requirements of Repentance","Washing Windows","“Be Reasonable!”","Faith and Water","Talk, Talk, Talk","The Humpty Dumpty Problem","Spiritual Incarceration’s One Exit: Emancipation through Execution","The Basis of Faith","Meditation","“Just Be Thankful…”","Dealing with Regrets","Spiritual “Brush”","Praying for Salvation","The Realities of Hell","Being Saved “Like the Thief on the Cross”","Direction, Distance, and Ratio & Proportion","What God Hasn’t Said","Whited Sepulchers- The View from Above","“Self-Diagnosis”","“Doing No Work at All…”","Winning the Imperishable Wreath or Being Disqualified","Giving or Receiving","“What Sort of People Ought You to Be”?","Hair","Reflections of Spring","Cain Faith and Worship","“Spiritual Amnesia”","Lessens from a “Wee Little Man”","Parents, Children, and Discipline","“A Month of Sundays”","The Underrated Value of Constancy","Preaching and Teaching the Word","The Power of God’s Word","Real Repentance","Are Your Children (biblically/spiritually) Home-Schooled?","Perpetual Infancy","The “Ancient Landmarks” vs. the “Novelty of the New”","Spiritual Sluggards","The “Ahhh” Factor","Good Biscuits at the City Dump","“Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep…”","“Oh Be Careful Little Eyes….”","Burying “Live” People","“Taunting”","What’s in a Name?","An “Attested” Man","Be Thankful for Pigpens","Dionysius and Damaris","Saftey Switches","Repentance, Weakness, and Rebellion","The Reasons Matter","Preacher’s and Pastor’s Patience Progresses to Problems with Pews and Parking"],"_resultNumber":10,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/index.html","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":10},{"body":["\"An ignorant conscientiousness may be quite as dangerous to a community as deliberate weakness.\" (Albert C. Knudson; The Beacon Lights of Prophecy ; New York: Eaton & Maines, 1914)  Last week, I was studying in preparation for our upcoming adult Wednesday bible class on the Minor Prophets. While reading some background and introductory material in Homer Hailey’s book on this subject, the author was discussing the fact that false prophets were often contemporaries of the literary, inspired prophets. He continued by classifying these false prophets as either (1) mercenary (prophesying for the highest bidder); or (2) political (nationalistic). While discussing the dangers associated with such men as these, he quoted from Albert C. Knudson who wrote: “An ignorant conscientiousness may be quite as dangerous to a community as deliberate wickedness.” ( The Beacon Lights of Prophecy ; New York: Eaton & Maines, 1914).  What an insightful statement! The phrasing and impact of the statement really struck me. Mr. Knudson seemed to be saying that just “doing something” in the name of religion without real knowledge of what God wants, expects, and commands, can be just as destructive as outright sinfulness. When the conscience is not guided by a “Thus saith the Lord…” and is therefore ignorant, it destroys the effects of true Christianity by dilution. It reduces the positive potential of influence by causing our interests and activities to be focused on the wrong things– like worshipping and serve God “In my own way” instead of the way He said! Therefore, a skewed view of what Christianity actually is results. People are then converted to a false concept of Christianity rather than to the real thing. And yet, they go away with a warm and fuzzy-feeling thinking that they have “carried out the command of the Lord” ( cf. 1Samuel 15:13 ). Their partial obedience, though perhaps purely motivated, is all that could result because of the lack of knowledge. Simply put: We cannot obey that which we do not know! Partial obedience and seemingly rational motivations were not accepted by God when King Saul rendered them in 1Samuel 15 . Saul had done part of what God commanded and had \"good\" (according to his logic) reasons ( see vv.20-21 ) for not carrying out the rest of what God had said. But he was told that he “did not obey the voice of the Lord” and “did evil” ( v.19 )! Did you get that? Samuel, God’s prophet, equated the actions of Saul’s ignorant conscientiousness with  “evil” !  Look at one more example from the life of Saul. In 1Samuel 13 Saul had the army of Israel assembled to do battle with the Philistines. The prophet Samuel had told him to not proceed until he could get there, which would be within seven days. On the seventh day, as the army of Israel began to scatter because of fear, Saul decided he had to do something. So, he offered the sacrifice himself and prepared for war. The point? Saul was the king from the tribe of Benjamin- not a priest from Levi. Only priests were to offer sacrifices to God. As soon as Saul finished the sacrifice, Samuel arrives and scolds him saying, “You have acted foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the Lord your God, which He commanded you…” ( v.13ff ). Saul’s ignorant conscientiousness caused him to disobey the Law of God. His feeling that he had to do something produced sin and ultimately cost him the kingship. In v.14 , we read of the prescribed punishment for Saul’s disobedience, “But now your kingdom shall not endure. The Lord has sought out for Himself a man after His own heart, and the Lord has appointed him as ruler over His people, because you have not kept what the Lord commanded you.”  Saul acted from desire to do good and with good motivations, but he violated God’s law. The lesson is simple: It does matter what we do! It is not just about being “honest and sincere” as so many believe and practice.   Ignorant conscientiousness destroys more than outright wickedness because it gives false hope and false security. Wickedness is recognized and everyone knows it doesn’t produce salvation. But because so many believe in the notion that “it doesn’t matter what you believe as long as your honest and sincere,” millions are led blindly to the slaughter thinking, like Saul, that they have “obeyed the voice of the Lord.”  How sad! Both Hosea and Paul lamented the ignorance of their own people ( Hosea 4:6 and Romans 10:1-3 ), but Jesus said it better than any other, “Not everyone who says ‘Lord, Lord’ will enter the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of My Father who is heaven.”  Matthew 7:21  Don’t be guided or motivated by an ignorant conscientiousness- know what the will of God is, and do it!"],"title":["Ignorant Conscientiousness"],"_resultNumber":11,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/ignorant_conscientiousness","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":11},{"body":["What does this mean and is it really all that serious?  I don’t know about you, but I am utterly disgusted by how commonly some today utter God’s name. It is not as if they are crying out to Him in prayer or even beseeching His favor. Instead, “Oh my God!” or “Oh God!” or just “God!” is something that has become an all-to-common expression that is utilized to convey shock, surprise, amazement, or even disgust by those who give little or no true thought, let alone obedience, to God otherwise. It is sickening to hear so many utter the most holy name known to mankind in such common and cursory ways.  Exactly what did Exodus 20:7 prohibit with the injunction against taking “the name of the Lord God in vain” ? The word vain (the Hebrew word shav ) refers to something which is empty, worthless, or nothingness. The last part of Ex.20:7 continues, “for the Lord will not leave him unpunished who take His name in vain.” This makes it serious business to flippantly use the name of God! It is to be used only with holiness and reverence, not as some sort of common expression utilized when our limited vocabularies can’t come up with anything better with which to express ourselves!  Look, I’m not trying to make a “big deal” out of this…. IT IS A BIG DEAL! The name “God” is the proper name of the Creator of the Universe, the Sustainer of Life, and the Savior and Judge of the World! When you utter this name it had better be with respect in tone, purpose, and context. Jesus further emphasized the seriousness of how we utilize the gift of language when He said, “that every careless word that men shall speak, they shall render account for it in the day of judgment. For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.”  Matthew 12:36 .  I don’t care if Paris Hilton made it popular to say “Oh my God!,” it’s still dead wrong to use the name of God in a careless, flippant way! Millions of young girls (and plenty of other folks who are neither young nor female) are taking in vain the name of the Lord God through this kind of influence and will ultimately be held accountable eternally for it. Certainly, this is no joking matter. Furthermore, look up the word “gosh” in the dictionary and you’ll find that it is simply a euphemism for “God.” So, saying “Oh my Gosh!” is no better and is in fact, just as sinful. Some may object by saying they didn’t know this or that it wasn’t the way or meaning that they intended. Look, words mean things. If we don’t know what they mean, we shouldn’t be using them. Such would certainly make them the kind of “careless words” which Jesus clearly condemned.  People who manifest no regard for God’s ways in their lives, ought not to be using God’s name at all– unless of course to cry out for mercy and forgiveness in repentance. But even people who do believe in God, and strive earnestly to live according to His principles, should be careful how, why, and in what context we utter His name.  I once saw a statement which said, if effect, “Rest assured that if you aren’t paying particular attention to what you are saying, your children will!” How much more so with God. Even when we aren’t paying close attention to the words we use and how we use them, God is and does. So be sure that when you utter the name of the Most High, you intend to and do so with the proper respect, fear, and trembling. In  Matthew 12:37  Jesus added to the statement quoted above,  \"For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.\"  Let’s remove “Oh my God” and it’s equivalents from our speech so that our careless words don’t condemn us before our God in the day of judgment.

But as wonderfully magnificent as God’s grace is, we have problems with it- two problems actually.  We sometimes refuse to accept God’s grace where He says that He will apply it. When we meet the conditions of grace, and there are conditions as will be shown below, we should have no problem accepting the application of it to our souls. In other words, if God’s word says that He will forgive us by grace when we meet His terms, and we do so, then we should be able to forgive ourselves because He has forgiven us! That’s the first common problem we have with God’s grace: refusing to accept and apply it where He does.  The second problem we commonly have with God’s grace is on the opposite side of the coin. Some of us want God to apply it where He never promised that He would. Certainly, all who are saved are so by the grace of God, Ephesians 2:1-10 . But how is this accomplished? Exactly what must take place in our lives for God’s grace to save us?  Let’s allow the Bible to speak for itself. The biblical record says that the ancient world had become so wicked that God decided to completely destroy mankind, Genesis 6:1-7 . Then v.8 records, “But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.” The Hebrew word ( chen ), translated as “favor,” is the O.T. equivalent of the N.T. word “grace” ( charis ). What this means is that Noah was shown “grace” by God. Why? The next verse reveals the answer, “Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his time; Noah walked with God.” ( Genesis 6:9 ) Noah’s faith and dedication to God allowed for grace to be extended to him.  Here’s the BIG question: How did God apply grace to Noah? “He saved him” is the right answer, but HOW God saved Noah is vital to our understanding of the application of grace. Did God just pick up Noah, his family, and all the animals and hold them in His hand while the flood destroyed everyone/thing else? Hardly! Instead, Noah was given instructions on how to build ark, required to gather all the materials and build it, then fill it with animals and provisions, enter it, and stay in it for over a year, cf. Genesis 7-9 . Sounds like “work” to me- but Noah found favor/grace by God. Here’s the key: God’s grace never has and never will remove our responsibility to be obedient to what He says we must do in order to receive it. Noah “found grace in the eyes of the Lord,” but only received the benefits of that grace when he did everything that God told him to do, 6:22 . What we do in meeting God’s conditions for the reception of His grace in no way compares in value to what we receive- salvation; that’s why it is called “grace” (undeserved merit or favor)!  Now let’s bring all of this forward. How does God’s grace save us? Titus 2:11 says, “For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men…” In what form does that grace appear? Read the continuation of the sentence in the next verse, “ instructing us to deny worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in this present age…” Question: Will all men be saved? Answer: No, Matthew 7:13-14 . But why not, if salvation is wholly dependent upon God’s grace with no mixture whatsoever of man’s faithful works? We just read that “The grace of God has appeared bringing salvation to all men”. God’s grace brought salvation to all men in the form of “instructions” - just like it did in the days of Noah. If you obey the instructions, God’s grace is applied to you in salvation. If you disobey the instructions, you will be just as lost as all of those who refused the preaching of Noah and were destroyed in the flood, 1Peter 3:20-21; 2Peter 2:5 .  Are we “saved by grace”? Absolutely! But that grace is applied through instructions which must be obeyed. It was so for Noah, and it so for us. On Pentecost in Acts 2 , those who came to believe in Jesus whom they had crucified asked, “Men and brethren, what shall we do?” They were  not  told what to  think   , feel , or  believe   - they were told what to   do :   “Repent and be baptized for the remission of your sins…” ( Acts 2:38 ) They too were given instructions that had to be followed in order to receive the benefits of God’s grace.  Let’s learn not to refuse to apply God’s grace where He has promised to apply it, and let’s also learn not apply God’s grace where He never promised that He would."],"title":["God’s Magnificient but Misapplied Grace"],"_resultNumber":13,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/gods_magnificient_but_misapplied_grace","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":13},{"body":["Origin and significance of names in general, and \"Christian\" specifically.  The origin of names is, at least to some, fascinating business. It is theorized that names, last ones especially, were derived from various sources. For instance....   Some names supposedly came from Occupations , like: Baker 〉 bakers of bread and pastries, Carpenter 〉 workers of and builders with wood, Smith 〉 blacksmiths, or workers of steel, Taylor 〉 perhaps from clothing manufacture or textiles, or Skinner 〉 those whose jobs it was to \"skin\" carcasses of animals; or drivers of mules.  Perhaps some names came from Characteristics , such as: Cotton 〉 fair skinned or white-haired, and Strong 〉 exceptional strength.  Likewise, maybe some names came from Nature or even Locations , like: Rainwater or Hill.  But some names are fascinating not because of from where they come, but where they go. Some names become everyday words- famously or infamously. They are called Eponyms (Greek, \"upon a name\"). About 35,000 have made in into the English language. For instance:     In the late 1940's there was a very picky Air Force officer- an aircraft engineer, who complained of the incompetence of one technician on his team, \"If there is any way to do it wrong, he will.\" His name? Captain Ed Murphy of Murphy's Law fame.    An English estate manager refused to lower rent rates for poor Irish tenant farmers inspiring the first rent strike and embargo of labor. His name? Charles Cunningham Boycott.     Did you know that the creator of the flying trapeze is also is immortalized by name? Jules Leotard.     Likewise and related, in the 1800's a feminists championed new undergarments for women. Her name? Amelia Bloomer.     Long before the golf club, the German military in WWI used a giant howitzer made by a firm owned by Bertha Krupp . Hence the term for the gun, \"Big Bertha\".     But the Bible also speaks to the importance of names:       Isaiah 62:6  \"And you will be called by a new name , which the mouth of the Lord will designate.\"      Acts 11:26  \"and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.\"    Acts 26:28    \"And Agrippa replied to Paul, ‘In a short time you will persuade me to become a Christian .'\"     There is no doubt from whence this name was derived,   \"by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene... by this name.... And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men, by which we must be saved.\"      Acts 4:10-12       Think again however, of Eponyms. Let's imagine the process of names becoming everyday words and descriptions being reversed so that we were named for our spiritual characteristics- either good or bad.    Would we be named  Faith  ,  Hope  ,  Charity  and the like or instead would monikers such as  Liar  ,  Cheat  ,  Thief  ,  Coward  ,  Faithless  ,  Hopeless  ,  Loveless  , and  Godless  be more apt to occur?    Yes, names can be important. We sometimes name our children after biblical characters of faith and fidelity. But you really don't hear much of boys named Judas or girls named Jezebel. This is because names mean something to us.  The name \"Christian\" should mean more to you than anything else.  If you're not wearing it, or not wearing it as you should, please consider  1Peter 4:16  ; and  2Thessalonians 1:11-12    .

In John 8:32b, Jesus uttered the oft quoted and seldom fully understood dictum, “the truth shall make you free.” While this statement is completely true and accurate, I fear it has been so often divorced from its contextual meaning that most fail to truly comprehend it. To properly understand the proposition, we must further ask and answer this question: What kind of truth is under consideration?    Divine truth saves. Jesus is not speaking with regard to secular/academic truth, scientific truth, political truth, or any other kind of truth that emanates from man! He is talking about spiritual truth, divine truth, and eternal truth. This “truth” by necessity must come from a spiritual, divine, and eternal being– obviously God! The specific “truth” to which He has reference seems to be the statement He made in the latter part v.24, “unless you believe that I am He, you shall die in your sins.” Obviously, those who reject this “truth” will not and cannot be saved by it! Why? Because the “truth” which saves is interactive– it must be known and applied by obedience.    Known truth saves. Rom.1:16 teaches us that the gospel truth is “God’s power to save”. But, that the gospel must be received into the mind/heart in order to accomplish that goal. It will not save those who are unwilling to hear it, read it, study it, and know it for it save. The word, in the language of James 1:21, it is the “word implanted, which is able to save your souls.” That is, the truth which saves is not only divine truth, but truth which is made a part of our hearts and minds (intellect and emotion).    Applied truth saves. Even truth that is divine and known does not, on those basis alone, save. Divine and known truth must also be applied in order to save. Note Titus 2:11-12, “For the grace of God appeared, bringing salvation to all men, instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in this present age”. Truth must be applied by obedience in order to receive its saving benefits. Otherwise, this passage teaches that God’s grace will save everyone– which obviously contradicts the clear teaching of other verses, cf. Matt.7:13-14,21.    Given these things, it is imperative that we realize and admit a few things;   It is still today “not within man who walks to direct his own steps” (Jer.10:23). We all need truth from God to properly direct and conduct all facets of our lives– in love (all applications, in work, in relationships, in everything!   Therefore, consider the validity of the following statement: “There is no problem we face in life that will be helped or solved by less teaching and study of God’s word.” While most would agree with this, is it really the way we approach the situations and circumstances of our lives?    Churches and Christians alike overall are de-emphasizing God’s word. We rarely make personal bible study part of daily routine. We want sermons that are filled with anecdotes, human quotes, and humorous illustrations instead of being “so preachy”. Bible classes and children’s church programs are becoming more about entertaining than educating. And when we have problems, we look for answers everywhere but the Bible. Such tendencies and practices surely make impotent God’s power to save! We cannot relegate “Truth” to sound bite status in our lives. It must instead be the basis of our lives."],"title":["Which “Truth” Saves?"],"_resultNumber":15,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/which_truth_saves","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":15},{"body":["\"against such things, there is no law\"   Paul wrote to the churches of the Galatian region regarding the “fruit of the Spirit” and listed love, joy peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, and gentleness. The last of these Christian qualities listed is self-control . Perhaps more than all others, this one is critical. Why? If one cannot  control self  , can they really add to any discernable degree the other attributes???   Self-control is at the heart of Christian character. A lot of perceived problems of Christian living are actually failures to control self. Failure with regard to this quality manifests itself in all sorts of areas. Christians (and everyone else for that matter) who do not have self-control will have problems with their temper, with their tongues, with their lusts, with their finances, with their family relationships, with their jobs, with their everything. Thus the bible requires the exercise self-control in “all things”  1Corinthians 9:25 . So when we don’t control ourselves , these problems just continue cropping up. Unchecked, they can destroy our happiness, our lives, and our spiritual well-being and destiny.  Unfortunately, we often spend all of our corrective energies on the symptoms rather than the problem. This is like trying to turn a horse we’re riding by grabbing his hind leg– it generally doesn’t work to well and may get us hurt! To keep with the illustration, in order to turn a horse we have to change his mind . We do so by putting a bit in his mouth as a convincer to demonstrate that it’s in his best interest to turn (or stop). Likewise, instead of making excuses or constantly asking forgiveness for saying, thinking, and/or doing things that stem from a lack of self-control, let’s fix the problem. We have to first get in control of self.   How do you and I get in control of self? Jesus told us. Please note:   “first clean the inside of the cup and of the dish, so that the outside of it may become clean also.”  Matthew 23:26   Also:   “But the things that proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and those defile the man. For out of the heart come evil hearts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, slanders.”  Matthew 15:18-19   Thus, the key to  controlling self  begins on the inside...with the heart or mind. This is the key to controlling all other manifestations of the lack of self-control which become evident through the other members of our bodies. When we can control our minds, we likewise control our tongues, lusts, tempers, envies, etc. OK, so how do we control ourselves from within– our minds? Again, look to the scriptures for the answer:   “And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.”  Romans 12:2   Renew you mind. Don’t feed it with the ideas, notions, and reasonings of the rest of society about what is right (or even acceptable) thought, action and reaction. Jesus said we are to “turn the other cheek” and Paul added that is better to be    defrauded  than to think, act and react like everyone else. Both require self-control. If we don’t  have  and  utilize  self-control we are wrong. And that means sinful . Look, self-control is required of Christians, not suggested .

Ever stood in front of the fridge “just looking” because you really didn’t know what you wanted? Or whether you were even sure that you were hungry? But you wanted “something”.  Many go through life that way…. looking blankly at the “refrigerator” of life and not knowing what they want. They may try a plethora of things they think they want or that they think will make them “happy” only to be left with their unhappy cravings left unsatiated. Perhaps they’re gnawing on the hind leg (wrong end) of the problem. Here’s what I mean: instead of going here, there, and yonder trying every thing under the Sun that you think might make you happy, try turning the problem around. What is it that is making you “unhappy”? What’s preventing your happiness?  It is said that a young Chinese Emperor once asked his family’s wise counselor, Confucius, what the single most important advise was that he could give to help him rule well. Confucius replied, “The first thing you have to do is to define the problem.” Good advise.  When we’re standing “unhappily” at the refrigerator of life, we have to first be able to define the problem of what’s making us unhappy- and it’s not a hunger for ‘things’ that needs to be fulfilled. I frame the situation this way because I believe that the natural state of man was intended by the Creator to be “happy”. He provided us with all that we need to not only live, but to love and to enjoy life. So, if we aren’t doing that, we’re doing life wrong! Look, you and I both likely know people with every “thing” anyone could want who are unhappy. And we know people who have practically nothing that are very happy. Similarly, we know people that next-to-nothing that are unhappy and folks with all the blessings of life that are very happy. So what gives? What’s the point then? The point is, among other things, that “happiness” never has been and never will be about “things”- either possessing them or not! Note Jesus’ words in Luke 12:15, “Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not even when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions.” You see, life and “happiness” is not about things- the abundance or the lack. “Where is this heading?” you ask? Back to Confucius we go.  Remember, he said “You have to define the problem.” Now if God wants, intends, and created man to be “happy” (and He does), and we’re not, then: 1. we don’t understand what “happiness” is; or 2. we don’t understand what prevents it!  Get that: if we’re not happy, something is preventing it. What is it? (And don’t you dare say that you don’t have some “thing” that you want!) Happy or “blessed” is the person who loves the Lord and is being successful at serving Him. Now, I did not say being “successful” in business, family, or even social popularity. When we are “successful” at serving God, we can be (and should be) happy regardless of these other “things.” Proof? Note Gen.4:4-7  “….And the Lord had regard for Abel and for his offering; but for Cain and his offering He had no regard. So Cain became very angry and his countenance fell. Then the Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen? If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up?…”   Sin is our problem that we need to identify, define, and abandon just like God told Cain. When we are righteously serving God, we can be happy regardless of our circumstance or situation. Don’t think so? Listen to Heb.10:34, “For you showed sympathy to the prisoners, and joyfully accepted the seizure of you property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one.” The people herein described were living righteously, and were happy so-doing.  Are you “unhappy”? Is sin the problem?

Instead, I have reference to how they were created, and therefore, how they operate.  The man, Adam, was created from the dust of the ground, Genesis 2:7 . He was and is, therefore, elemental. He’s basic, fundamental, and rudimentary in a lot of ways. Men are generally uncomplicated.  The woman, Eve, was not created from such simple sources. She was fashioned (wow, what an appropriate word) instead from the rib of the man, Genesis 2:21-22 . She was and is, therefore, much more complex. As men are generally uncomplicated, women are, again generally, much more complicated. Though God was the ultimate Source of both of their origins, men and women were created from very different materials. As a result of both the materials used to create them, and certainly the purposes God had for each of them, men and women are very different in form and function.   The man was created first, and such is apparently important, as evidenced in 1Timothy 2:11-13 and 1Corinthians 11:7-9 . But lest we males begin to get all “high and mighty” about our position as dictated by creative order, let’s also remember that it was the man who was deemed incomplete “alone” (before Eve was created), Genesis 2:18 ! Therefore, Eve/woman was formed as the “crown jewel” of all of God’s creation. Only after her creation did God look upon all He had made and declare that it was “very good”  Genesis 1:31 .  All of that was to get to this: these differences in the creation of men and women may help to explain something about each one’s thought processes. Men, being the relatively uncomplicated beings we are, think pretty simply and pragmatically. Perhaps this is an oversimplification, but bear with me anyway, please. And women, generally being the more complex creatures of the species, think in more complicated ways. Even how we express ourselves bears these things out. Men typically say, “I think that…” But women are more prone to say, “I feel that…” Men’s thoughts are more basic and fundamental because they usually come stripped of the complications of emotion. Whereas women’s thoughts are complicated with emotions- in fact, women’s thoughts often stem from their emotions. Such is not meant as a slight to either sex- it’s just the way God made us.  It’s a good thing that God made men and women the way He did too! A man’s thoughts and decisions often need the tempering influence of the emotions of a woman lest they become tyrannical and dictatorial. And a woman’s emotions often need tempering with the pragmatism of a man lest they become so complicated with feelings that clarity is lost, and decisions become overly difficult. Before you accuse me of sexism, hear me out.   Ephesians 5:22-31,33 outlines the primary duties of husbands to their wives, and wives to their husbands. Have you ever wondered why husbands are told to “ love your wives” and wives are told to “be subject to your husbands”? Why aren’t the wives told to “love their husbands”? Could it be so because, being women, they’re already good at the emotional aspects of marriage? On the other hand, “subjection” is a mental thing. It is deciding to willingly submit yourself to another’s decisions. Conversely, the husbands in Ephesians 5 are told to “love their wives.” Why aren’t they told be pragmatic in their headship of the family? Again, could it be because they are already that way, but need to temper their decisions with love? Think carefully about it, won’t you?  Now here’s the real beauty of all of this: God created men and women to be more together than either of them could ever be apart. Such is the true splendor of becoming “one flesh” in marriage, Genesis 2:22-24 . Marriage “done right” means not only each partner realizing and fulfilling their proper roles within the relationship, but also recognizing the magnificence of God’s purpose for us in marriage- that each “half” makes the other “whole.” Marriage done right is a foretaste of heaven on earth. And, marriage done wrong is a foretaste of hell on earth. God didn’t make us the way He did, and marriage for us the way He did, to make us miserable, but happy. Such is achieved by recognizing the distinctions in how men and women were made, and how those differences are designed to make us “whole” together. By the way, my lovely bride and I have making each other “whole” for 26 years as of July 5 th , and I am constantly thankful for her.","Man and woman both are different in many aspects.

Why? Consider Acts 4:12 , “And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men, by which we must be saved.” Think about some of the implications of this passage…  When the Holy Spirit inspired (which literally means “God-breathed,” see v.8 ) Peter to say there was “no other name…by which we must be saved,” please realize all the names this eliminates from being able to produce salvation.  It eliminates the name “Abraham” - thus Jews could no longer rely on physical ancestry to Him for their salvation. John made this clear from the beginning of his ministry in Luke 3:8 , “Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father,’ for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham.” To be saved eternally, Israelites must obey Jesus.  It also eliminates the name “Mohammed” from being able to procure eternal salvation. Whatever good this man accomplished, or whatever good is accomplished in or through his name, the pardoning of sins is not among those accomplishments.  It also eliminates the name “ Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi” (aka “Mahatma Gandhi”) from being able to save souls from eternal damnation. There is no doubt or debate that this man did a tremendous amount for Hindus and Muslims in India and South Africa, and for all men in a sense. But, all the good that he accomplished was for this life, for no soul is saved in the name of “Gandhi.”  It also eliminates the name “Confucius” (“Kong Qiu”) from being able to provide eternal security. Confucius lived between 551 and 479 B.C. His philosophy championed strong family loyalty- even to the point of ancestor worship, and eminent respect of children for their parents and wives for their husbands. He is perhaps the most oft-quoted philosopher of all time, and no doubt had many good and morally profitable teachings, but did not and cannot “save” anyone.  It also eliminates the name “Rasputin” (Grigori Yefimovech Rasputin, 1860-1916), the Russian Orthodox Christian “mystic” philosopher. He was thought by some to have greatly influenced the Russian Emperor (Nicholas II) and his wife and son (Alexei), and therefore nation, as a physic and faith healer. Others consider(ed) him to be a religious charlatan. Whatever the opinion of his talents and abilities, they did not include the salvation of men’s souls!  It also eliminates the name “Nietzsche” (Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, 1844-1900) the German philosopher famous for “the death of God” argument; and the name “Nostradamus” (Michel de Nostredame, 1503-1566), the French pharmacist (then called “apothecary”) who published volumes of prophecies which some claim predicted many modern events. However popular or unpopular these philosophers and “prophets” may have been in their times, or in ours, does not make their names powerful enough to produce the salvation of men’s souls. The same can obviously be said for any philosopher, scientist, or proclaimed “prophet” save “the Prophet” ( cf. Deuteronomy 18:15,18 ; John 6:14 ), Jesus Christ.  But, this also eliminates “Joseph Smith” (the proclaimed “prophet” of The Book of Mormon), “Mary Baker Eddy” (the prophet and founder of the Christian Scientist), “L. Ron Hubbard” (Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, the “prophet” and founder of the Church of Scientology and Dianetics), “Martin Luther” (from which the Lutherans derive their name), “John Calvin” (who put forth the doctrines of predestination which became “Calvinism”), “John Wesley” and “Charles Wesley” (Anglican clerics whose foundational doctrines came to be Wesleyanism), “Charles Spurgeon” (aka “The Prince of Preachers,” 1834-1892), and “Thomas Campbell” or “Alexander Campbell” (this son and father, who, along with others such as Barton W. Stone, sought to “restore” the church back to the N.T. pattern, rather than to simply “reform” it). None of these names, whatever their contributions to or detractions from the gospel, are “the name” through which salvation comes! Why?  It’s actually very simple. None of them died on the cross and was raised from the dead, Acts 4:10 ! And, none of them became “the very Corner Stone” of our salvation and association with God in the Church, Acts 4:11 . Therefore, being baptized in their name(s) accomplishes nothing, Matthew 28:19 ; “observing all” that they command likewise does not produce salvation, Matthew 28:20 ; and, their words are not those by which all will be judged, John 12:48 .

Have we just interrupted what we were doing- what we truly prefer to do and will returning to doing after our obligations to “worship” are finally over, or, are we truly making a purposeful priority of praising God? Unfortunately, “worship” for many is more a product of the former rather than the latter. If we thought we could still be “Christians” without “having to go” we would. True worship takes preparation. If we prepare our minds to the purpose for which we are supposed assemble, our dress for, activities in, and attitudes toward worship will follow. Our dress will be appropriate for the occasion of giving honor to God rather showing off the latest fashion, our bodies, or our disregard and disrespect for God and the occasion. If we dress the same for worship as we do for work, for play, or for lounging around the house, is there really any honor, respect, reverence, or praise being shown to God? Under the Old Law, those who served in the worship services of God were commanded to make and wear special garments while so doing. We are not under the Old Law and I am not suggesting that we take on the “robes” of ecclesiastical denominationalism. I am suggesting that our minds should be prepared to worship and that, if they are, our clothing for, our participation in, and our attitude regarding worship will manifest it.     We must endeavor to “worship” while we’re here. Many do everything but “worship” even though they go to the trouble of attending. Why??? We might as well stayed home! If we spend our time watching others (especially babies and small children), daydreaming, doing our nails, be bored, etc. etc. etc., then no “worship” has come from us and the true purpose for assembling has been wasted on us. We can all “worship” if we would just try to do so. Think about praising God while you sing! Think about thanking God while you pray! Think about remembering Christ’s sacrifice while you eat! Think about honoring God as you study! It will work and you will not only worship, you’ll enjoy it!     These are just a few preliminary suggestions to improve our worship and help us give more honor, praise, respect, thanks, and adoration to God. In subsequent articles (but not necessarily successively each week), we will look at additional ways that those who lead us in worship can improve their efforts that we all may “worship” more effectively, and more happily."],"title":["Improving Our Worship-1"],"_resultNumber":20,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/improving_our_worship-1","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":20},{"body":["This is the fourth is this series of articles designed to help us do a better job of worshiping the Lord during our services. We've looked at ways that both the people in the pew and those responsible for leading us in worship can be more effective. This particular article deals with singing praises to Jehovah.    Before any particular aspect of our worship services can be “improved,” we must first understand, accept, and implement the principle that worship is important, and should always be our best effort to glorify Jehovah. Singing praises to His name is vital to that endeavor. The writer of Hebrews put it this way: “Through Him then let us continually off up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name.” Having already discussed ways that we could improve our worship in the areas of the People in the Pews, Announcement Making, and Leading Public Prayer in previous articles, let’s give attention to:    Worshiping in Song     In this article, we’re not interested in reading musical notes (shape or standard), or understanding the difference between a flat or a sharp. Those things have their place, they’re just not the focus here. But there are two different groups to be addressed– the Song Leaders and, again, the People in the Pews. Both must work together to make our singing a joyful noise to the Lord, instead of whatever else it might become. So, let’s look briefly at some suggestions for both groups that may help.     For the People in the Pew-       Remember the Objective. There is no doubt (or claim made to the contrary) that singing benefits those participating. Through it we “teach and admonish one another” (Col.3:16) and “speak to one another” (Eph.5:19). It must also be acknowledged that singing does our hearts good. Paul and Silas may not have been singing praises in that Philippian jail for purely personal reasons, but it sure can lift our spirits. While these things are all true and beneficial reasons for singing praises to the Lord, it must be at the same time acknowledged that they are not the primary reason for so doing. Singing is a specified mechanism for our hearts to express praises to the Lord! If we remember this purpose as we sing, it will make a difference. I promise!       Do it heartily unto the Lord. Since the primary purpose of our song service is to praise our Great God, then doesn’t it naturally follow that we should do it heartily? Paul wrote to the Corinthians of the importance of singing “with the spirit” and “with the mind also” (1Cor.14:15). God is certainly worthy of all the praise, and more, that our spirits and minds can muster. So strive be enthusiastic in your singing. Give it your all– God deserves no less! Sing out. God is not deaf and He does hear our hearts, but prefers to hear our hearts through the praise of our voices. Besides this, you’re not “teaching” or “admonishing” your brethren if you’re not singing where they can hear you. Surely more than just the person immediately in front of you would benefit too! Just as inaudible prayers do not benefit the congregation, neither does inaudible singing.       Follow the Leader– it’s what he’s there for. You may not be trained in music, and that’s OK, you don’t have to be- but the song leader probably is, at least to some degree. He’s picked songs that he feels are appropriate and is trying to help us give our best to the Lord. Help him do just that by following his lead. Also, let him know you appreciate his efforts– it will encourage him and make our singing even better.        For the Song Leaders-      Remember the Objective. Your purpose is to help the congregation do their best toward praising God in song. It’s not to impress the congregation with your knowledge or expertise in music. Neither is it to make the song-service entertainment for those assembled. We’re praising the God of the Universe in song and that deserves our best efforts. So, (1) Dress appropriately for the occasion– neither flashy or showy, nor to attract attention to yourself, but neither to distract from the purpose through untidiness, being slouchy, or in a manner that shows lack of respect for the occasion. (2) Whenever possible, prepare beforehand. Sometimes one is pressed into service to cover for another who did not make it to services. Such cannot always be helped. But otherwise, think ahead and plan a song service with the objective eliciting the most possible worship of God from the congregation.       Pay attention to mechanics. Announce the number of selected song(s) clearly, loudly, distinctly, and repetitively. We want everyone to know what song to sing. It even helps to say the number a couple of different ways. For example, “Three-hundred, forty-three; number 3-4-3; ‘Let Him Have His Way With Thee’, Three-hundred, forty-three.” Let the congregation know before you begin what verses to sing, if one or more is to be omitted, or if the chorus is to be sung once at the conclusion of the verses, etc. Also announce any other special arrangement or emphasis that should be noted before you start the song. But, always remember that not everyone in the audience knows music as well as you do. You want to include as many as possible in the song service rather than to exclude some by making the songs too technically difficult for them to participate. Whether you beat the time with your hand or not, remember you are leading. And that includes more than just starting on the right note. So, lead.       Sing with the spirit. Not every song is a happy, up tempo, and rousing rendition of jubilation. Some are prayerful. Some are even mournful. But how many of us have sung “Sing a Be Happy” in way that sounded more like a funeral dirge because of the timing, tempo, and lack of enthusiasm manifested by the song leader? The point is to be enthusiastically mindful of the purpose and tone of the song and help the congregation by leading it appropriately to that purpose. Remember, your leading the congregation’s worship. Be sure to help them utilize the spirit of the song to sing with spirit to God whether the song is one of praise, humble repentance, or tender memorial.     Certainly more could said. But I’ll leave the musically technical aspects of singing and leading to those more qualified to speak on them. I simply wanted to make a few suggestions that might help us to better worship the Lord in our song service. Maybe I did– hope so."],"title":["Improving Our Worship-4"],"_resultNumber":21,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/improving_our_worship-4","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":21},{"body":["Th   is is the fifth in this (delayed) series of articles. Due to other pressing duties, this installment was postponed and then inadvertently forgotten- sorry. The series on the whole has tried to highlight ways that both those who lead as well as the people in the pew can do a better job of worshiping our great God, Jehovah. This particular installment examines a couple of points relative to the Preaching /    Teaching   part of our worship.         To be fair, and since we’ve already written regarding ways to improve the announcement making, song leading, and prayer leading aspects of our worship services, it seemed only right to include an article on Preaching / Teaching.      I once asked a high-school age class (years ago at another congregation) what the difference was between preaching and teaching. After considerable thought, one bright young lady responded, “Well, teaching is kind of like talking to someone about the Bible, and preaching is more like talking at someone about the Bible!” Perhaps there’s more truth in that definition than us preachers want to admit!      But for the ease of treatment, let’s at least consider them to be equal for our purposes here. What then is important to maximizing the benefit of the time we spend in our worship service relative to preaching/teaching?       The elimination of distractions, at least to the degree possible. Obviously, some things can’t be helped. But the speaker needs to be neat and appropriate in their dress and demeanor. Not only would green hair be a distraction, so also would slouchy attire. Remember, you’re speaking for the Master- so dress and groom yourself like it matters to you! Likewise, endeavor to avoid repetitious speech patterns and becoming monotone. Also, remember that not everyone in the audience hears as well as you do. Speak clearly, distinctly, and loud enough for everyone to hear what you’re saying. It’s easy to become distracted by any of these things. On the receiving end of the lesson, eliminating as many distractions as possible helps here too. Lessons will always be “boring” if we allow ourselves to be distracted from the points being made. When watching babies, watching outside, or watching the inside of your eyelids take precedence to reading and understanding the word of God, some refocusing should be done. Sermons are usually much more interesting when we really listen to them. Sit where you’re not likely to be distracted. Get plenty of sleep the night before, and remember that the speaker likely spent several hours of study in preparation to impart the truth of God’s Word– try to give him your undivided attention while he speaks. He’s selected a topic that he thinks is important to your understanding. Give him your attention and he’ll likely reward it with some kernel of truth that you did not know, had forgotten, or had not really thought about.     Considerations of time. It had to come up– it always does. And there’s usually room for improvement on both sides of the sermon. The preacher needs to be considerate of time, really he does. He doesn’t need to site or quote fifteen passages that all say the same thing when one or two is sufficient. He doesn’t need four illustrations to make the same point. And he shouldn’t try to cover the whole Bible in one sermon. He should say what he has to say with zeal, enthusiasm, and efficiency. When speaking for God, we need to make every word count. We preachers really shouldn’t take advantage of the audience by subjecting them unnecessarily and excessively to “myths and endless genealogies” (1Tim.1:4). It is true that the mind can only absorb what the backside can endure. But, there is another side to these considerations of time– what about the people in the pew? If the preacher/teacher is doing the best he can to be well-prepared, interesting in his delivery, enthusiastic in his presentation, and devoted to the purpose of educating and enlightening his audience, then let’s be considerate of his efforts by being listening patiently. Some people become upset if the sermon “goes over” never considering how much variation there is concerning when the preacher gets to start the sermon. Whether or not the service starts on time, how many announcements there are, how long the prayers are, how many people are served the Lord’s Supper, and how long the song service is all affect when the sermon is begun. If the preacher has done his best to prepare an interesting, informative, important, and truthful lesson to meet the spiritual needs of the congregation– and to fit it in a 40 minute time slot, and then is only given 30 minutes (or 25), what should he do? And yet, if the “Amen” isn’t said on time, it’s the long-winded preacher’s fault. Brethren, if we’re on that tight of a schedule, we ought not to call it the Lord’s “Day” but the Lord’s “Hour”. Think about it. I’ll try not to take advantage of the time we spend studying the Word of God together if you’ll try not to begrudge the Lord the time. There’s no spiritual problem that we have that less time worshipping the Lord and study His word will help. Sermons used to an hour or two long. Then they were 45 minutes long. Now, some seem to want them to be 20 minutes or less. Even efficiency can only go so far in placating the desires of some folks to be somewhere else doing something else.     On both sides of the sermon (preacher and audience) , let’s remember why we’re here. It’s important when we sing, when we pray, and when we partake of the Lord’s Supper, and it’s important when we study too– to remember that we’re here to give glory to God. The preacher does it by: (a) being Truthful; if the sermon is not true to the Book, it matters not how interesting or timely it was; (b) on point; meandering storytelling, the recitation of poetical quotes, anecdotal tales and sophistry does not save souls, Truth that is needed and relative to the audience does; and by (c) doing his best to be considerate of the audience by being interesting and efficient in his presentation of the gospel. These things give glory to God and His Word. On the other hand, the audience helps worship to take place during the sermon by: (a) giving the utmost of attention to the sacred text since it’s the Word of God; (b) doing their best to glean whatever positives can be derived from the efforts of the evangelist despite his weaknesses; and by (c) remembering that attitude counts with God. Doing the right things is important– doing the right things for the right reason and with the right spirit is critical to being pleasing to God.      Let’s see if we both can’t do better to make the sermon portion of our worship that much more meaningful to us and pleasing to the Great God whom we serve. With a little extra effort and patience from both the preacher and audience sides of the sermon, surely much good can come. It’s not supposed to be an adversarial relationship. We’re supposed to be working toward the same goal of being “built up” in our most holy faith! Let’s see if we can’t do a better job of serving the Lord in this aspect of our worship as well."],"title":["Improving Our Worship-5"],"_resultNumber":22,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/improving_our_worship-5","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":22},{"body":["This is the second in this series of articles discussing ways that the congregation, and more specifically, those who lead it, can improve the worship services. Announcement makers are the subject under consideration.    In the previous article on this subject, suggestions were made for the congregation that could help toward improving our worship of God. In this piece, and the ones which follow later, let’s consider some ways that those who lead us in worship can help us toward that same goal.    Announcement Makers     Though this aspect of our services are not really part of the “worship,” it nonetheless has great impact toward and influence over the service. In most places, the necessary announcements are made at the beginning of the service. So, the announcement maker is the first person in front of the congregation as they prepare to worship. It is therefore important to get off to a good start by making the announcements in a way that helps to properly prepare the congregation to worship. How so? First of all, he lets the congregation know how the worship will proceed– what will be done and who will lead us in that part of the worship. Such assists with the “decency and order” of the service. Secondly, the announcer makes the congregation aware of those whom it needs to be cognizant in prayer, enabling that portion of the service to be more effective. Thirdly, but no less important than the others, he also welcomes those who have come to worship. This includes visitors as well as members. All should be made to feel welcome. A smile, an enthusiastic greeting, and efficient dissemination of the necessary information of the announcements will go far in leading the congregation toward proper praise and worship.      Some practical suggestions for Announcement Makers:        Watch your tone. Be pleasant, upbeat, and welcoming to the audience without being irreverent to God. We’re not up there to tell jokes or entertain, but neither are we there to squelch the happy spirit of the congregation into some sort mournful dirge of religious service. We can and should be positive, enthusiastic, and welcoming without being flippant.       Be prepared. This is admittedly difficult. Unfortunately, much of the information to be shared through the announcements has been gleaned in the last few minutes before the service begins. While not all of this can be prevented, it makes it very difficult for the poor fellow making the announcements to be smoothly efficient in his delivery of them. Those making the announcements are scheduled weeks in advance and publicized. Don’t wait till the last minute get your announcement to him. This way, he can read it beforehand and has opportunity to ask you for clarifications to be sure he properly understands the necessary information he is to announce. Likewise, he then has time to organize his announcements in an orderly (and legible) fashion. So, announcers, be prepared as much as possible by starting early, being sure you understand what you’re to announce, and make adequate legible notes to be able to efficiently convey the information. And one more thing on preparation, dress and groom yourself in such a way as to manifest your interest in serving before the Lord instead of looking like you interrupted something else you were doing to run to worship right quick. We want Jehovah and the congregation to know we respect the occasion of worship and our participation in the leading of it.       Speak where all can hear and understand. Southside, like most congregations, have people who have a hard time hearing. Stand close enough to the microphone and adjust the volume of your speaking up at least enough for you to be able to hear yourself through the speakers over your on voice. Speak clearly and distinctly. Running your words together, failing to emphasize all the sounded letters in the words, and having overall poor diction is not overcome even by adequate volume when it comes to comprehending what you say. So, speak loudly enough to be heard, and slowly and clearly enough to be understood even by those who don’t hear well.       Be efficient. While we shouldn’t hurry through any part of our worship service, neither should the preliminary announcements be drug out any longer than necessary. To that end, don’t read to the audience what they can read for themselves in the bulletin. If there is information in the bulletin that needs to emphasized, corrected, or updated, by all means do so. But don’t insult the intelligence of the congregation by reading to them what they have read, or can read, for themselves. Likewise, be specific enough to give the necessary details of what’s being announced without including unnecessary information. The congregation needs to know that Bro. Jones is in the hospital, what room he’s in, whether he can receive visitors, and generally why he’s there. They do not need to know how much fluid has been drained from his infected toe, etc. etc. etc. This brings up a related point. Not everything needs to be announced. Obviously, some details should be omitted, but some items presented for announcement should also be omitted. There are times when discretion must prevail. There are better ways and times to present some information to the congregation than through a formal announcement. If you’re not sure whether an item presented to you should be announced, ask one of the Elders– is part of what they’re here for.      As Batsell Barrett Baxter said in his book, Speaking for the Master– A Study of Public Speaking for Christians , “The man who makes the announcements is more important than their place in the service. If he is nervous or poorly trained he can do almost irreparable damage to the spirit of worship.” (p.15, on “Making Announcements”). It’s not difficult to make the announcements– it just takes the proper perspective, preparation, and practice. When done well, they set the stage for worship that is pleasing to the Master as well as enjoyable and purposeful for the participants. So, be cordially upbeat and welcoming; be prepared; speak sufficiently loud, clearly, and distinctly; and render the necessary information as smoothly and efficiently as possible. It will make a difference in how well we worship."],"title":["Improving Our Worship-2"],"_resultNumber":23,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/improving_our_worship-2","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":23},{"body":["This is the third in this series of articles discussing ways that the congregation, and more specifically, those who lead it, can improve the worship services. Those who lead us in prayer are the subject under consideration this time.     In the two previous articles in this series, we’ve made some suggestions toward improving our worship as (1) people in the pew with regard to our preparations for, and participation in, worship; and (2) announcement makers in setting the proper tone for our worship and covering the necessary announcements with modicum and efficiency. Now, let’s turn our attention to another facet of leading the worship:     Offering Public Prayer     Certainly, some of the New Testament’s teaching on prayer and praying is specific to individual private prayer. Jesus said in Matthew 6:5, “When you, when you pray, go into you inner room, and when you have shut the door, pray to your Father who is in secret…” But it is also true that several passages, written to especially to churches, seem to be urging public prayer, cf. Eph.6:18-19 ; Col.4:3 ; 1Thess.5:25 ; 2Thess.3:1 ; and 1Tim.2:8 . So, here are some suggestions, some from the text, and some just practical considerations, which might improve the portions of our services dedicated to prayer:       Pray audibly (mechanics) . Excessively loud tones can be considered by some to be irreverent– but it is equally true that hushed tones, perhaps emanating from, or intended to portray humility, do not allow for those being led in prayer (the audience) to participate in the prayer, or give their “Amen” to it. If you are to lead another or a group in prayer, you must speak loudly enough for them to hear you. God will hear your heart , but other people must hear your voice to be able to pray with you. And isn’t that the point of leading prayer? Speak into the microphone loudly enough to be able to hear yourself over the speakers, always remembering that others may not hear as well as you do. You want everyone in attendance to be able to pray with you, so speak loudly enough, and clearly and distinctly enough that they can do so. And by the way, these things are just as important when leading prayer for the Lord’s Supper– everyone needs to be able to understand you then too. Humility is good, but it comes from the heart, not a soft or inaudible voice.       Pray reverently, sincerely, and humbly without  ecclesiasticism (attitude) . When leading public prayer, we should always remember to Whom we are speaking– God Almighty! This awesome privilege is often wasted by instead speaking to the audience. As a prayer-leader , you are speaking to God for the people, not speaking to the people for God! When we forget this fact, we tend get preachy , and want to use flowery or ecclesiastical -sounding words characterized by excessive devotion to “religious” formalities. Certainly we should acknowledge the greatness of the God to whom we are praying, but not with vain words that those we seek to lead don’t understand. Speak to God simply, sincerely, and from the heart– such a prayer will be heard by Him and appreciated by those you lead. Using words and phrases because they sound pretty or “prayerful” is condemned by Jesus in Matt.6:7 . God knows our hearts– so let Him hear our sincerity , not our piety (false or otherwise) in our prayers.       Pray with an open heart (content) . Men are sometimes afraid to lead public prayer because they “don’t know what to say.” Often, the unfortunate result is that we retreat to over-used and under-understood phrases that we hear everyone else use. Just because we are leading others in prayer doesn’t mean that the simplicity, honesty, and humility that characterizes our private prayers should be abandoned. Do we have trouble knowing what to say in our private prayers ? Not likely. This doesn’t mean that everything you pray in private should be made a part of public prayers you lead, but it does mean that although the content may be slightly different between our public and private prayers, our attitude should not. So, for what should we pray publicly? The things on the heart(s) of those being led is a very good place to start. Remember that you’re leading prayer for the congregation– you’re speaking to God in their behalf. Pray regarding things they want expressed to God. Public prayer should be characterized by praise , acknowledgment of God’s greatness and blessing of us, thanksgiving , and petition on behalf of the congregation’s spiritual and physical needs . But let’s not let our prayers become the recitation of a “wish list” to a celestial Santa-Claus god. The model prayer of Matt.6:9-13 contained but one physical request, and it was for “daily bread.” Certainly, we should prayer for and regarding physical necessities , but too often our public prayers are dominated instead by physical wants . Also, please try to avoid utilizing the same phrases or words repetitively. It becomes distractive to those being led and winds up just being “fillers” to make the prayer longer rather than better, cf. Matt.6:7 . Take time to read and study the content of Paul’s prayers for brethren recorded in Eph.1:15-21 ; 3:14-19 ; and Col.1:9-12 .       Leading public prayer is a privilege. Pray so that all may hear. Pray with the proper attitude. Pray for and regarding the things on the hearts and minds of the congregation. And remember: we’re speaking to God for the people instead of the other way around. Beyond these things, speak honestly, openly, and from the heart and you’ll do just fine."],"title":["Improving Our Worship-3"],"_resultNumber":24,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/improving_our_worship-3","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":24},{"body":["Sometimes, we can even learn something from a pet!    Most folks who’ve been around me much over the last several years knew “Baby”. She was a sweetheart of a dog (except occasionally to small children) who spent a tremendous amount of her time in the back of my pickup– either happily running from wheel-well to wheel-well as we traveled down the road, somewhere or waiting patiently sometimes for hours in the back while I worked/visited/etc. for another opportunity to do the same. She loved to “go”.    Once, when Donna’s parents came up for a visit and to go out to eat, I decided we all could not fit into their car. So as I unlocked the truck door, Baby was right there wriggling excitedly and hoping for an opportunity to also ride along. As soon as I looked at her and said “OK,” she immediately leaped into the bed of the truck and gleefully sat down in her spot to await the ride while I went back inside to retrieve something forgotten. Then Donna came out, not knowing I had told Baby she could go too, and began to tell her to get down. The usually very obedient dog cowered slightly, but refused to budge. Donna then repeated the command more forcefully, but to no avail– Baby just shyly turned her head and refused even to look at Donna. Ray, Donna’s father, began to laugh at the whole situation. Donna, surprised at Baby’s refusal and not really understanding what her father was laughing at, asked what was going on. Ray simply replied that  “Baby knew whose dog she was\"  and that  \"Philip told her she could go.”  She therefore was not about to get out of that pickup! What’s the point?  In one word, Loyalty.  If I had told her she could go, nobody else was going to tell her she couldn’t! (Besides, she really wanted to go if everyone else was!)    Loyalty is a trait just about everybody respects, but few enough to be so themselves.  We see examples of the lack of loyalty everywhere from the bedroom to the ballpark. Husbands and wives are disloyal to one another and the vows they make for the sake of instant gratification. Team owners and professional ball players alike seem to have loyalty only to self-promotion and the almighty dollar rather than one another.    Several years ago, a good friend of mine made a highly complimentary statement regarding his wife. This beautiful woman worked in a very public place and was required to dress very professionally. Undoubtedly, she attracted a lot of attention– not because of immodesty on her part, just because of the very public nature of her work. I asked this friend if he ever worried about her being “hit on” as I assumed happened a lot. “Not at all.” was the immediate reply. He then proceeded to tell me that his dear wife had a very rough childhood in which nobody really seemed to care anything at all about her. Then when he came along, in her teen years, and showed her common courtesy, she immediately responded favorably to him. Ultimately they obviously were married. He told me all of that (and I’m telling you all of it) to get to the point of his telling me that she was  “fiercely loyal”  to him.  What a beautiful story! What admiration simple and loving loyalty inspires!    OK, so we admire loyalty in dogs, professional sports, and spouses. What about loyalty in religious matters? Several N.T. passages remind us of the faithfulness of God towards us:  1Cor.10:13  tells us He is faithful not to allow us to be tempted beyond what we are able to bear;  2Thess.3:3  reminds us that God is faithful to strengthen and protect us from the evil one;  Heb.6:18  explains how it is impossible for God to lie and that therefore we should strongly encouraged; etc.  But are we loyal to God?  As a team player should be toward an business owner? As a dog would be faithful only to his/her Master? As the Bride of Christ should be toward her Husband? Would we, as has been famously said, prefer “Death to dishonor” with regard to our loyalty to God?    Where do your true loyalties lie? To self and the pursuits of what “I” desire? To family and friends even to the point of allowing them to come between you and your service to the God you claim to be yours? To “getting ahead” or “making it in the world” ?  Surely, no one or no purpose deserves our loyalty more than God!  He saved us by the cruel sacrifice of His own dear Son  “while we were yet sinners”  (  cf. Rom.5:8  ).     With what loyalty do we repay His? Half-hearted efforts to go through the motions of worship and service? Or true, dedicated, and loyal service that we could never abandon or betray?

Allan resigned recently due to his declining health.  This congregation of the Lord’s people had its beginnings about forty years ago. For the first thirty-five years or so of its existence, it never had Elders. Southside first appointed Elders in 2000. There were two: Allan Balch and Mike Terry. There have been (and continue to be) many men who have had great and positive impact on this collectivity of saints who were never appointed as Bishops here. But the church finally reached a point of maturity that allowed it to be scripturally organized in 2000. There had been “good” years and “bad” years previously, but these two men stepped up and fulfilled the need for leadership that allowed growth to continue from the time that they were appointed to the present. Other Shepherds were later added– Joe Buck Strong (in 2002 or 2003, I forget), and most recently, Eddie Arrington and myself a couple of weeks ago. All have and will continue to make positive contributions to the work here at Southside, and the Lord’s Cause overall.   But from the beginning of our Eldership, Allan and Mike understood and stressed that the office was one that, although certainly had honor associated with it (1Thess.5:12-13), was nonetheless characterized by responsibility and work (Heb.13:17; 1Pet.5:2-3). Since Allan was diagnosed with cancer, he has talked about stepping down from the Eldership due to his own perceived limitations with regard to “the work” of an Elder. Others and I have encouraged him to stay on in the Eldership for the last year or so numerous times– mostly for selfish reasons. We wanted the benefits of Allan’s knowledge, wisdom, and judgment for the congregation despite whatever physical limitations that might exist. Simply put: Allan at times might not be able to recall some detail such as a person’s name, but he could still think, reason, and judge from the scriptures and wisely apply them in the appropriate way. We all desired to continue to receive the rich benefits of his abilities. But Allan, together with Barbara, has finally insisted that we accept his resignation from the office of the Eldership of Southside. And we do so, “yes” with sadness, but much more with appreciation for a job extremely “well done”!  An Eldership, any working Eldership, is a collaboration of the various talents and peculiar abilities each man brings to the job. This in no way diminishes the “qualifications” of any, but simply recognizes the unique talents of each man. Mike Terry has certainly brought much to the table of work for Southside– but most of Bro. Terry’s work is quietly done “behind the scenes.” Such is in keeping with his nature of never shirking a duty or responsibility, but conscientiously fulfilling each in his own quiet and unassuming way. Allan’s talents and abilities complimented this in such a wonderful way! Allan, due to his optimistic and outgoing personality, became somewhat the “face” of Southside. He made most of the public announcements for the Eldership (even after Joe Buck was appointed) because of his eloquence, public speaking abilities, and the clear and kind way he was able to articulate the decisions and directives to the congregation– and we depended on him to do so. These abilities we will sorely miss in the Eldership and in the congregation as a whole, but certainly respect his decision to step down. Allan’s concern with remaining an Elder has always been that he did not stay in a job he was unable to perform– for any reason. This is in complete harmony with his supreme commitment and the conscientious way he perceived his role. It has always been the way he “set his hand to the plow” and it’s part of why we love and appreciate him so much. He has discussed with me many times how important it was/is for Elders to be “workers” and “leaders who lead by example” rather than just honorary figureheads. He leaves the Southside Eldership with that great legacy and example.  Early on in his tenure as one of our Elders, Allan expressed to me the concern he had regarding his serving in this capacity. Though eminently qualified, his ever-present and ever apparent sincere humility caused him to say, “Philip, I have never even really been in a congregation that had Elders, let alone been one!” That fact notwithstanding, Allan Balch became and was one of, if not the, finest Elder(s) with whom I have ever worked. I just wanted to express publicly, and personally, my appreciation for Allan’s dedication and service to the Cause of Christ at this place. I have indeed learned much from him in the past, and look forward to continuing to learn from him in the future. I, and our other Elders, will endeavor to continue to serve you and Christ after his fine example of leadership. Paul commanded the Thessalonians concerning their Elders to “esteem them very highly in love because of their work.” Allan Balch made that admonition one of the easiest to obey."],"title":["The Southside Eldership and Allan Balch"],"_resultNumber":26,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/the_southside_eldership_and_allan_balch","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":26},{"body":["Consider not only \"what\" the right thing is, but also \"why\" we should do it.    Face it: we pretty much live in an instant gratification society because we are instant gratification people . We want medicines to make us feel better “right now”. We want to take our purchases home “right now” rather than to pay them out in full and then receive them– hence credit card debt. Furthermore, not only do we want (or perhaps better expect) to be consistently rewarded for doing the “right” thing, we demand that the reward also be instant. There may indeed be many different causes for this mentality. Not all of them are necessarily bad. But there is one area in which this instant gratification way of doing things just won’t work…..with God.    Oh sure, there are immediate benefits both to becoming a Christian as well as living a Christian life. But, there is no doubt that when we study the word of God carefully and understand the concept of heaven as the primary reward of right conduct, Christianity isn’t instant gratification oriented! In fact, despite the claims of health & wealth preachers to the contrary, it never has been and never will be! ( see  Matthew 5:12; Luke 6:35; Colossians 3:23-24 ; and especially Hebrews 11:37-40 ) The eternal abode with God in heaven is the reward for godly living– not some other here and now compensation.     But let’s take it a step further. What really troubles me is that so many seem to be only motivated by immediate recompense. Few people seem to want to do the right things simply because they are the right things. It seems that we (in the world, hopefully not in the church) are only motivated to action by reward. Are we really that carnal and materialistic? Do we only act when there’s something in it for me ? What happened to the pride of doing the right thing being reward in and of itself?    For example, I recently read an article which was a “write in with your question for the Doctor” kind of thing ( Ask Dr. Gilda , I think). An older man was writing to ask the “Dr.’s” advice about a woman he was dating. Her husband had died a few years back and they had been dating a while. He stated that he would very much like to marry her. But if they married, then “she loses her pension and cannot get it back should things not work out, and she is reluctant to give up this security.” Don’t misunderstand, I get the dilemma they face and even sympathize with the lady. But what gets me is the advice “Dr. Gilda” offered. Among other things she said, “Older, accomplished people often resolve this dilemma by choosing to go against their traditional upbringings and cohabitate without the legal document. The only question is whether they can emotionally live with this choice.” Again, I think I understand the problem, the question, and the answer– I just don’t like the answer because it is not the “right thing to do” and it is rooted in instant gratification (rather than waiting until you’re sure about marriage).    If we are going to be the kind of people God wants us to be, and that will enjoy the eternal kingdom of heaven, we are going to have to commit ourselves to doing the “right thing” simply because it is “the right thing”! Whether doing it brings happiness and joy to everyone around us or it causes everyone around us to rise up and stone us to death, we have to decide and do the right thing. Of such character were the people described in Hebrews 11 . The text there speaks of Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Jacob, Joseph, and Moses. But please notice carefully the unnamed faithful of vv.35-38 . And then vv.39-40 say, “And all of these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised, because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect.” Doing the “right thing” caused them to be driven from their homes, imprisoned, stoned, sawn in two, and otherwise put to death. Not quite instant gratification/reward for obedience is it?  But they did the “right thing” simply because it was the “right thing” and will be rewarded with the glories of heaven eternally for it! And brethren, that always beats anything else."],"title":["Doing the “Right Thing”"],"_resultNumber":27,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/doing_the_right_thing","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":27},{"body":["I noticed several things were \"missing\" from our last church family Get-Together....   Church family get-togethers are great tools to allow church members to get to know one another better. And obviously, they provide occasions for young and old alike to share food, fun, and fellowship. But at the last one the Southside church family had, there were several things that were noticeably missing that are typical of large gatherings of people lasting all day…..   There was no foul language.  “Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth…” ( Eph.4:29 ) There was a lot of laughter- young and old. There were prayers offered. There were spiritual songs of praise that were lifted up. There were brothers and sisters in Christ enjoying conversing with one another. There were kids laughing and yelling and being kids. But not single curse word was heard. Funny, huh?   There were no dirty jokes or suggestive party games.  “and there must be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks.” ( Eph.5:4 ) Groups of men were relatively alone for an hour or so- not one ugly joke was told. They kidded and teased each other over several games of horseshoes, but not a single vulgar story or joke was told. The games that were played could be enjoyed without worry about offending anyone. There was nothing “off color” or suggestive by which to be offended. There didn’t have to be to have fun!   There was no alcohol.  “For the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousals, drinking parties and abominable idolatries. And in all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same excess of dissipation…” ( 1Pet.4:3-4 ). Surely a gathering of so sixty plus people couldn’t have a really good time all day without any beer! Ah but they can and did! This group didn’t need any artificial stimulation to have a great time. So not a single youngster was exposed to the bad example of “adult beverages”. The police were not needed to break up any fights or remove any belligerent participants. And no drunk drivers endangered the lives of everyone on the roads.   There wasn’t immodesty.  “Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discretely…” ( 1Tim.2:9 ). The men didn’t have to remove their shirts to have fun despite the warm temperatures. And the women didn’t parade themselves around half (or whole!) naked. They were there to enjoy each other’s company to have a good time. Amazing! People can be modestly and discretely clothed and still have fun.   There wasn’t any television, video games, or blaring music. Not this are necessarily always sinful- just that they weren’t necessary. We didn’t need T.V. shows showing us how immoral humankind can be. We didn’t blatantly violent video games to entertain us. We didn’t need vulgar lyrics blaring and rattling the windows. We had the beauties of God’s natural creation to “watch”. We had water balloons to with which to “fight”. We had small children laughing and four part harmony singing praises to God and edification to each other to “listen to”.  Yep, there sure were several things “missing” which are common to large gatherings of people. But I don’t think the people who came to this gathering “missed” any of them!"],"title":["Things Missing from Our Last Church Get-Together"],"_resultNumber":28,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/things_missing_from_our_last_church_get-together","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":28},{"body":["Before you respond to the title, “No,” this is not an article about my mental state- though it may be a good description of the same! Instead, this is a piece about the dangers of being “just a little off” in our religion. Many “play” at religion the same way they “play” at horseshoes: with the notion that “close” is good enough to be successful. You’ve probably heard the old expression, “Close is good enough in horseshoes and hand grenades,” but does it really apply to our faith, and the practice of it?  Let me illustrate the problem of being “just a little off” this way: What if, while I was typing this article, one of my hands was just one key position off on the keyboard? The phrase “just a little off” would have instead read, “judy s liyylr ogg”! Get the picture? “Just a little off” can make all the difference in the world, and in the next world too.  A biblical example of being “just a little off” is found in Leviticus 10:1 . Two priestly sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, found that “being just a little off” religiously can be very costly. God specified that fire for the burning of incense should come from the altar, cf.16:10 . But, our text says they utilized “strange fire” to make their offering. Evidently, their fire did not come from the altar as God had commanded (it is also probable that they weren’t supposed to be the one(s) making the offering in the first place). Perhaps they reasoned that “fire was fire,” and that being “just a little off” wouldn’t matter in the worship service to the Lord. If so, THEY WERE WRONG! The next verse says that “fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord.” Obviously, being “just a little off” wasn’t “close enough” for God!  Are we then really comfortable with the notion that “as long as you’re honest and sincere” being “just a little off” is good enough in our worship today? In John 4:23-24 , Jesus indicated that worship must not only be “in spirit” - that is, with the right emotion and intention, but that it must also be “in truth”- or, according to the dictates of truth as revealed by God. We must worship God as He says, and are not at liberty to perform some act that is convenient for us, or to our liking, call it “worship,” and presume that He will accept it. Instead, we had better be sure that our efforts to worship our great God come from Book, Chapter, and Verse authority, rather than our own desires and tastes. In worship, being “just a little off” is still “off”- and wrong, even when well intended.  Let’s back this up a little further. If “just a little off” isn’t close enough in our worship- even when sincerely given, then is it somehow sufficient for salvation? Can we do “most” of what God says is necessary to be saved, and still be acceptable to Him? Is “close” good enough for salvation? Note the words of Jesus in these passages regarding God’s requirements for salvation: John 8:24 , “for unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins;”  Luke 13:3 , “unless you repent , you shall all likewise perish;”  John 3:5 , “unless one is born of water and the Spirit , he cannot enter the kingdom of God.”  Belief is a change of mind (intellect) and heart (affection) that leads to repentance , which is a change of direction of and in life. Baptism is being “born again” as a “new creature” ( 2Corinthians 5:17 ) in Christ.  If we just believe, but do not repent, we’ve changed our minds without really changing our lives. We’re close, but “just a little off”! If we come to believe that Jesus is the Christ, and we allow that knowledge to truly change the course and direction of our lives, we’ve changed our minds and our lives, but have not changed our Father by being born again through baptism, cp. John 8:44  à Galatians 3:26-29 . Again, we’re close, but “just a little off.” Now, you tell me: which one of these commanded actions can we omit, or be “just a little off” on, and still be “close enough” to be acceptable with God?  Please carefully consider 1John 2:3-5 , “And by this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments. The one who says, ‘I have come to know Him,’ and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him; but whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God has truly been perfected…”"],"title":["“Just a Little Off”"],"_resultNumber":29,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/just_a_little_off","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":29},{"body":["The word of God says, “Hate evil, you who love the Lord…” in Psalm 97:10 ; and, “Hate evil, love good…” in Amos 5:15 . This is certainly not going to be a hate-fomenting article; the world has far too much of that already. And, to point out what should be obvious, God (not man!) gets to determine what is “evil” and what is “good,” and does so through the revelation of His Word to us in the Bible, Galatians 5:19-25 . But aside from these things, here’s the question we should be asking, “Is there a difference between  hating what is evil  and  loving what is good/right   ?” Can one be done without the other? The answer is, “Yes,” and “Yes.” One can “hate evil,” and even be repulsed by it, without really “loving right.”  In the parable of “The Good Samaritan,” Luke 10:25-37 , Jesus uses the story of an unfortunate man, two “religious” men, and a perceived enemy to teach an important lesson of mercy and compassion. In the story, the unfortunate man , while traveling, fell prey to robbers who beat, stripped, and left him half-dead. Both a priest and the Levite separately happened upon the unfortunate man, and saw his pitiful and obviously helpless condition, but “passed by on the other side” regardless. These piously religious and seriously devout men undoubtedly “hated evil”- possibly so much so that they didn’t even want to be close to the “results” of it. Perhaps they were concerned with “getting involved,” or even with becoming “unclean” through contact with someone they might have thought to be dead, cf. Numbers 19:11-13 . But whatever their motivations, and though “hating evil,” they certainly did not “love good” enough to even check on, let alone help, the unfortunate man. They just “passed by on the other side.”   The Samaritans were a race derived from people imported by the Assyrians to settle the land from which they had captured, killed, or deported the northern ten tribes of Israel (722 B.C.). These “imports” intermarried with the remaining Jews who were deemed not worth the effort to kill or deport to Assyria. So, the Jews of Jesus’ day hated the Samaritans as “half-breeds” and “interlopers,” cf. John 4:9 ; which is probably why He chose a Samaritan for the “good guy” in this story.  In the parable, this perceived enemy of the Jews surely “hated evil,” and was repulsed by it, as were the priest and the Levite. But, his hatred did not end with simple disdain for evil, and avoidance of its results. Because he also  “loved good,” he “felt compassion, and came to him, and bandaged up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them; and he put him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him,”  Luke 10:33-34 . Additionally, the next day, he paid the innkeeper to care for the man further, and promised to reimburse any additional expenditures incurred when he returned, v.35 .  The priest’s and Levite’s neighbors would certainly have vouched for them as “haters of evil.” But, the man who fell among the robbers could vouch for the Samaritan that he was also a “lover of good.” Please contemplate these things, and further consider the following:  · We shouldn’t minimize being properly repulsed by and fleeing from true evil, for the Scriptures teach the necessity of this, 2Corinthians 6:14-18 ; but,  · Such is very different from turning a “blind eye” toward the innocent results of evil, or avoiding the responsibility of human compassion and care, 1John 3:17-18 ; 4:20 .  · Being even properly and rightly repulsed by and “hating evil” is not the same thing as “loving good.” No one will be saved on the Day of Judgment solely because of what they avoided, or didn’t do, Matthew 25:31-46 .  “Loving good” requires a corresponding “hate for evil,” and harm it produces, to the extent that it causes us to do something to mitigate or eliminate those effects with compassion, kindness, and the truth of the gospel, Ephesians 5:11-17 ."],"title":["Hating Evil and Loving Good"],"_resultNumber":30,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/hating_evil_and_loving_good","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":30},{"body":["To whom do you call when trouble or danger appears?    The other day I heard a fellow talking about his fear of water. It seems he had almost drowned several years back at a Galveston beach and forever vowed to never get in the water again. But the thing that really caught my attention, and got me thinking about more than the story in general, was a particular statement that he made. He relayed that while being dragged out sea by a strong undertow, and swimming it seemed as hard as he could for an hour, he said  “Several ‘Hail Marys’ and made up a bunch of other stuff.”  What an incredible statement! Now understand, this was not then and is not now a “religious man” by any stretch of the imagination. You probably could tell as much by the statement he made. But when he really feared for his life, he cried out to God for help. Several thoughts came out of this account for me:      Even the godless know on whom to call when they’re really in trouble. They may have neither given much serious thought to God before, nor have never made any substantial efforts to serve Him with any degree of true faith previously, but when life seemingly hangs in the balance they cry out to God.    Also, despite this fellow not being a Catholic, and to my knowledge never having any association with Catholicism, he was saying “Hail Marys”! The Bible never states that anyone ever cried out to Mary for help in time of need. It does, however, record a plethora of people throughout the ages of biblical history who have cried out to the Lord in desperate times. I guess this part of the statement just goes to show the far-reaching effects of denominational error even upon the uninitiated.    But the really amazing thing about what this guy said was that he admitted– even seemed to revel in the notion, that he just “made a bunch of stuff up”. I confess that I do not know exactly to what this refers. It could have been promises to faithfully commit to the Lord’s ways in exchange for extrication from the present distress, or it could have been some other sort of “religious sounding” statements made by a truly ignorant spiritual mind doing the best it could. Likewise, I suppose he could have meant that even he recognized the insincerity of his words. It was just an incredibly striking statement to me.      So I got to thinking. Obviously, there is a point to be made here that perhaps there are no true atheists when one faces seemingly imminent peril. This seems to me to be further evidence of the innate nature of man to recognize and acknowledge not only God’s existence, but also His power despite their previously spiritually unconcerned lives.  Romans 1:18-19  states this as fact when it says, “  For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them.”  (emphasis added– PCS).    But we should also concede the fact that acknowledging God in times of peril is certainly not bad! (  see James 5:13a  ) True, we should all be willing not only to acknowledge God, but also to faithfully serve with our obedience to His will at all times rather than just in time of trouble. Still yet, to whom should we otherwise cry out when in despair??? While there is life and breath, all should confess God’s existence and power to save.  Romans 14:11-12    “For it is written, ‘As I live says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall give praise to God.’ So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.”  There will come a time when such confessions will be too late. The rich man  Luke 16  was perfectly willing to confess the Sovereignty of God  after  he was dead! Obviously, it is far better and eminently more beneficial to confess God while there is still  “time”  (  cf. Hebrews 3:7,13,15; 4:7  ).    Don’t wait for bad circumstances to cause you to “cry out” to God for salvation.

Thus, we live “by faith” in that we trust God as a “rewarder of those who seek Him.”     But neither faith , nor the element of trust included within it, are unsubstantiated. God does not expect blind faith or unmerited trust from us. Instead, He provides abundant evidence upon which our faith is to be built, and the most substantial of foundations for our trust of Him. Notice again the scriptures:     “For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made , so that they are without excuse.”  Romans 1:20 .  Get that: all should be able to comprehend the eternal power and divine nature of God from just observing the wonders of the world which He created. One might ask, “How so?” For anything to be created, someone must exist prior to create it. God is the eternal First Cause of creation for He existed before it– thus His power is “eternal.” As to the second part, God could have created a colorless world completely without beauty to merely sustain its inhabitants, but He didn’t. He created a world of consummate beauty and spectacular wonders to fulfill the most intense aesthetic cravings of our discerning palates. Thus, we see the goodness of God’s \"divine nature.\" He wants us to enjoy the things He created for us. All of which should bolster both our faith in Him, and our trust of Him.    There are many things which God did not choose to reveal to us. Deuteronomy 29:29 admits as much, “The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our sons forever, that we may observe all the words of this law.” To spend much time in speculation, discussion, and disputes about things “not revealed” is pointless and foolish at best, and perhaps sinful at worst. I happen to believe that the things God didn’t tell us, but about which sometimes wonder, were not revealed for a simple reason: we either don’t need to know, or are perhaps incapable of comprehending. Trust leads me to conclude that it was not in our best interest to know, or God would have told us!    This brings us back the quote of our title from Emerson, “All I have seen teaches me to trust the Creator for all I have not seen.” The poet had it right. Everything that we observe from nature, and everything God has revealed to us in His word, teaches us to trust Him regarding anything and everything we have not seen, and about which we have not been told!    Thus, we don’t have to know exactly what will happen when we die in every detail, we trust Him by living as we should. We don’t have to know what our resurrected bodies will be like, we trust Him by making our bodies here conform to His image. We don’t have to know all of the parameters and details of heaven, we trust Him by making ourselves living sacrifices here. And so on, and so on, and so on.    Isn’t all of this exactly what the Apostle Paul meant when he wrote to the Corinthians, “For we walk by faith, and not by sight” ? I think so. Don’t trouble yourself by trying to walk by sight - it is utter futility. Have faith in God, and trust Him . Doesn’t everything He has done, and everything He has said, warrant it? Sure it does!

Way back when I was a youngster, I had a boss that was somewhat famous (or infamous, to some) for his colloquialisms. He was some sort of head for the Republican party in that whole part of the state. As such, he went (in 1984 I think) to the National Convention and made a big splash with his big bag of folksy sayings. The big city big- time reporters were somewhat enamored with all his “country charm and wit”. So he appeared almost nightly on the television spouting his wares. For those of us who knew him, it was more of an eye-rolling occasion of moderate embarrassment than anything else. But I have to admit a couple of things about his big bag of quaint axioms: I still remember some of them and there was a lot of practical truth embodied in them. I remember them because they were short and at least mildly humorous. But I am also caused to think about the appropriateness of the truth they contained when situations or circumstances bring them to mind.     One of these proverbs is the one contained in the complete title: “The little duck said, ‘Hmmmp if it doesn’t rain, I’ll just walk!’” Now you may have to think about this one a bit, but if you do, you’ll come to recognize a few salient facts about the statement:       The little duck had two primary means of getting from one place to another since he was a “little” duck. Since he couldn’t yet fly, he could either swim or walk.      The mode of his transportation was therefore dependent upon circumstances beyond his control.      So while he could not control the external circumstances of his predicament– like whether or no he could fly or whether or not it rained, he could still be determined to utilize the options that were available to him to accomplish the goal he had in mind of getting from point “A” to point “B”.      And perhaps just as importantly, he seems content with either of his available options to accomplish the goal. He didn’t spend his time whining (or quacking or squawking– whichever is appropriate for ducks) about his inability to fly or the circumstance of the weather. Certainly it’s easier for ducks to swim rather than walk, but if swimming wasn’t an option he didn’t besmirch to additional required of him to “get there.”       Now, does any of this sound familiar? These are all lessons taught and principles of thought and action encouraged in the Bible! This highlights the fact that Truth is eternal– you can changed the examples but the underlying truth is still the same. 1Peter 1:24-25 , “For, all flesh is like grass, and all its glory the flower of glass. The grass withers, and the flower falls off, but the word of the Lord abides forever. And this is the word that was preached to you.”     Are you as understanding as the little duck? When life presents you with seemingly difficult circumstances, do you:       Squawk about all the things beyond your control or concentrate and utilize the options that are available?      Do you manifest a quiet and determined spirit to do the right thing (our getting from point “A” to “B”) with contentment? Are you happy to walk even if you can’t fly or swim?      Are you willing to work a little harder when the circumstances of your journey make it more difficult? Or do you just decide to quit and turn back? Or take easier road of the detour into compromise?       I’ve always heard that in order to train a dog, you first have to be smarter than the dog! I know I’m mixing metaphors here, but surely we are (or at least can become) as smart as a little duck!

Most of us have heard, at least at some point in our lives,   \"Oh grow up!\"   Hopefully, it was when we were much younger and it was said to try to get us to act more our age  physically  ! But unless I’m missing the point being made (which is certainly not outside the realm of possibility), that is exactly what Peter is saying in   1Peter 4:3   regarding  spiritual maturity:      “For the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousals, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries.”    Most likely, when we were told to “grow up” as youngsters we were acting immature having reverted to behaviors, mannerisms, and speech patterns that would have been perhaps expected of a child much younger. We were old enough to not only know better, but to act better so we were told. Rightly so. The same is true for most of us spiritually. That is, there are times when we just don’t act our spiritual age . We revert back (hopefully temporarily!) to previous practices, mannerisms, and speech that characterized our lives before coming to Christ. We don’t act our spiritual age– and  we know better, we just don’t  do  better.  It is a challenge for most folks. The pull of less than noble and Christian thoughts, words, and deeds is strong– otherwise where would the temptation of sin be? Satan would be out of business for anyone converted to Jesus Christ and he would have to spend all of his time and energy concentrating on the unsaved. Folks, that’s the way it is supposed to be! God’s plan is for us to “put to death” the works of flesh and the body of sin we formally inhabited ( cf. Romans 6:5-7 ). Unfortunately, instead of putting them to death, we put them in a state of “suspended animation” so we can drag them out later for a moment (or more?) of spiritual immaturity!   This seems to be exactly the kind of thing Peter is addressing in our text when he says, “the time past is already sufficient” for you to have put aside such things. While we usually look at this passage to identify, distinguish, and discuss the sins listed, the greater focus perhaps should be on the fact that these things and others like them should no longer be a problem or temptation for us– let alone a part of our practice. But for Christians in Peter’s day and ours, they still are because we’ve refused to grow up spiritually! Immature actions are to some degree expected of those who are immature both physically and spiritually and are therefore tolerated. But the real problem comes along when Christians refuse to grow up. It is a problem not only for them personally with regards to their eternal well-being, but also because the spiritually mature   reproduce . Where maturity is lacking, reproduction will lack too. Could this be one of the reasons why churches today do not grow as they ought? If they are made up predominantly of the spiritually immature how can they grow? They can’t because immaturity is a refusal to grow  personally  that always translates to a lack of growth  collectively   if it is characteristic of enough people in a given congregation!  What about you? Is the “time past already sufficient”   for you to grow up spiritually? Should you have already   “put aside” some spiritually immature practices long ago? Are you refusing to grow up because you like living in sin? Are there things you think, say, and do of which you know better? Do you keep telling yourself that “someday” you’re going to get all these things straightened out in your life and start living the way you know you should? Is it “high time” for you to have matured and be reproducing yourself spiritually instead of constantly needing to be reminded to grow up? Brother, sister, unless you are legitimately a babe in Christ ,  “the time past is already sufficient”  for us all (yes, me too) to just grow up!

One of their favorite words seemed to be “just”- as in, “If you will just do this”, or “just believe this,” or “just feel this way in your heart.” These concepts bother me somewhat in light of what the New Testament as a whole teaches. But...  I think I understand why biblical salvation is “free” in that we can neither buy nor earn it ( Romans 5:15ff ), and the how the Lord’s way is “easy” in comparison to the devil’s, or man’s, way ( Matthew 11:28-30 ). And I think I also understand that salvation requires that we  believe  and  do  certain things which are relatively simple in obedience to the gospel ( Mark 16:15-16 ), and that when we believe and do them, we will  feel  differently about God, ourselves, life, and eternity ( 1John 3:18-20 ).  But here’s what I don’t understand: If salvation is supposedly so free and easy that the word “just” is accordingly prevalent in the way folks describe its requirements, then please explain what Luke 14:25-35 and 1Peter 4:17-18 are all about.  Luke begins by telling us about the multitudes of people that were following Jesus, v.25 . The Savior then turns to them and almost seems to discourage them from becoming His disciples by telling them how much it will cost! Note the itemized list of the “cost” of discipleship: 1) a  subjected love   of your family  (“hate” is from the Greek word miseo, which means “to love less”- not to harbor animosity or ill will), v.26 ; 2) dailycarrying your own   cross  (an implement of your own death), v.27 ; 3) a commitment strong enough to last a   lifetime  , vv.28-32 ; and 4)  valuing   your faith more than all of your earthly possessions , v.33 . Yes, salvation is absolutely “free” in the sense that we can neither earn it nor buy it, but such certainly doesn’t negate the fact that it has a definite “cost” factor.  And then there is 1Peter 4:17-18 , which reads, “For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God? And if it is with difficulty that the righteous is saved, what will become of the godless man and the sinner?”   Again, there are few things that seemingly must be taken into account from the context of this passage. Almost from beginning to end, Peter’s epistle seems to have a couple of main points: 1) those who intend to follow Christ must live lives of holiness and right conduct, 2:11-12 ; 2) so living may well bring persecution and suffering, 2:19 ; and 3) God expects Christians to keep doing the “right/good” things even when “bad/wrong” things happen because of obedience, 2:20-23 . What is “easy” about that? It seems difficult enough to do the right thing when doing so has no personal and detrimental consequences. So, how is it “easy” to be obedient to God when others ridicule and persecute you for it?  Now before you begin to think I’ve switched sides and started playing for the other team, let me explain a few things. The “difficulty” to which Peter refers in 4:18 is not a reference to becoming a Christian. He is speaking of the difficulty of remaining a faithful Christian until the end despite persecution and suffering. Note the context of the previous, and following verses, ( vv.16,19 ), “but if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not feel ashamed, but in that name let him glorify God…Therefore, let those who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right.” He is not saying that it is “difficult” to become a Christian (and thus to be initially “saved”)- he is saying it is “difficult” to maintain the necessary faithful obedience through the fires of persecution all the way through to eternal salvation (which was also Jesus’ point back in Luke 14:25-35 by the way). And perhaps just as importantly, he is saying that those who never even begin the journey to salvation by obeying the gospel certainly have no hope.  So, is it easy to become a Christian? Yes, if you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and are willing to obey Him in baptism ( Mark16:16 ). Is it easy to live the Christian life that our initial obedience requires to complete our salvation? No, but it sure beats the alternative- both here and hereafter!"],"title":["“Free” and “Easy” Salvation?"],"_resultNumber":35,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/free_and_easy_salvation","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":35},{"body":["Having and Pursuing  Spiritual Goals (as compared to holiday shopping)...     What if we treated the pursuit a great spiritual year in 2006 like we were shopping for it?  Now I know men and women shop very differently in most cases. And since I am a man, I can’t very well use a woman’s perspective on how they shop (too dangerous to do so anyway!). But bear with me one this one.  If we were to go shopping for a great spiritual year in 2006, what considerations would we make?     Have a Purpose.  Do you ever go into a store and then wonder,  “Now why am I here?”  or  “What was it that I came here to get?”  If you want a great spiritual year in `06, then  Know what you’re after!  Sometimes we may shop just to shop (women at least). But spiritually, we had better know what we’re looking for and where to get it!      “Therefore I run in such a way, as not without aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air; but I buffet my body and make it my slave, lest possibly, after I have preached to others, I myself should be disqualified.”  1Corinthians 9:26-27      Know the Cost (and be willing to pay it!).  In shopping, we compare prices. So too, in spiritual matters we need to know the cost of having a great spiritual year. It will cost you considerable amounts of  time  and  effort  – most everything worth anything does! But being a truly spiritually strong person may also cost you some of your friends, could cost you all of your family, and it could certainly cost you financially– doing the “right” thing(s) is not always as lucrative as the alternative. But, being a spiritually strong person will also provide you with  friends  (in Christ) who stick closer than brothers; a  family  that not only includes a Father and a Brother but also many brethren who will love and care for you like no others; and a  retirement plan  that is truly out of this world! Indeed, one of my favorite songs is “Heaven Will Surely Be Worth It All”! Please carefully review the words of this great hymn– it’s #253 in  Hymns for Worship  .    Contemplate the Time.  When something we need can be found at multiple sources, we not only  count cost  but we also factor in the  time  we have to make the purchase. “Is it worth the extra time to save a little money?” becomes a consideration. In spiritual shopping, it’s not so much a  cost/time  factor as it is a  time/limit  factor. Here’s the deal:  we don’t know and can’t know how much time we have. So, we can’t afford to  hold out  for a better deal down the road. We’ve got to do the best we can each and every day to get the most spiritual growth and benefits we can– tomorrow may indeed be too late.      “Come now, you who say, ‘Today or tomorrow, we shall go to such and such city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.’ Yet you do not know what you life will be like tomorrow. You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.”  James 4:13-14      Maintain your Purpose.  In shopping terms,  “Stick to the list!”  When we don’t have a shopping list, or when we fail to stick to it, we wind up wondering aimlessly through the store trying to remember what we’re there for and picking all sorts of things along the way that we either don’t need or can’t afford- or both! The same is true with shopping for a great spiritual year in 2006. We can’t allow ourselves to get side-tracked on the aisles of life that don’t have what we really need. It has been well said about spiritual priorities that  “The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.”        “Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.”  Philippians 3:13-14      Let’s not just shop for a great spiritual year in 2006, let’s have one!

Imagine that we’re all assembled at church services on Sunday morning. It is that time just before the first prayer or song leader (or announcement maker) rises and moves to the front of the auditorium to start the service. You know- that time when the noisy clamoring of cheerful greetings and polite inquiries fill the building because we’re all really glad to see one another on such a beautiful Lord’s Day. And then suddenly, in just that moment that the crowd falls silent in preparation for the beginning worship, the projector flashes to life all on its own. The image on the screen is much clearer and brighter than normal, and….  A picture of Ashley Adams (this “Ashley Adams” is completely fictitious, as are all of the characters which follow in our imaginary story) dissolves onto the screen. Everyone oohs and aahs over the picture-perfect portrait displayed. But then something very different and dreadful happens- actual photos begin to flash on the screen one by one of every sin Ashley ever committed. Every trite or catty thought, every smug or careless or unkind or hateful word, every secret sexual lust and sin- pictures that capture every sinful thought and word and deed, begin to parade across the projector screen before our eyes! Hundreds of photos seamlessly chronicle every iniquity, every poor choice, every thoughtless word, every lustful emotion, and every sinful moment of her life. We sit in stunned disbelief and shocked silence as these images flicker before us. Everyone, even those who have been victims of her sometimes-sharp tongue, feel so sorry for poor Ashley! Despite heroic efforts by several of the men to shut down the projector, nothing seems to work. Since it is mounted on the ceiling, and appears to be divinely powered and directed, there’s really nothing that can be done to stop this deeply painful recitation of Ashley’s “other” life. She sits in horrified embarrassment, sobbing uncontrollably as everyone sees all the ugliness that she has so adeptly kept hidden under the shiny façade of her “Christian” life for years. But then it gets worse, much worse.  When Ashley’s train-wreck of shame finally concludes with her most recent displays of depravity, the screen goes momentarily blank. Everyone sighs deeply; grateful the tragically painful presentation appears to be over. An aghast hush creeps through the audience, which is inexplicably larger than normal. Those sitting around Ashley try to console her, but everyone else just sits silently- wondering what to do next. Then, slowly, another image begins to appear on the screen. It seems like several minutes, but isn’t more than a few seconds until Ben Baker’s visage gradually comes into focus on the projector screen. The spectacle of sin begins again, chronicling every single iniquity of Brother Baker’s life, beginning with his teenage years and progressively moving forward through to just last week, starts to unfold- slide by stunning slide. If the images of the young and beautiful, but sometimes a little “wild,” Ashley shocked the audience, there are no words adequate to describe our utter dismay at the decadent degradation now displaying on the screen of one of our longtime Elder’s life! Surely this couldn’t get worse, but it did…  Gradually, after Brother Baker’s “show” ended and Cade Conner’s started, it began to dawn on us: This display of depravity is going through the church directory in alphabetical order! Now, shock and horror turns to dread as one by one we realize that this “show” is eventually going to put our own “secret sins” up on the screen for everyone to see. Just imagine!  Now, this story, and the characters in it, is completely fictitious. But, realize that a similar scenario is depicted in 1Corinthians 14:22-25 . In fact, this passage was the “inspiration” (excuse the pun!) of the story. However, neither the plausibility nor the possibility of such actually occurring today is really the point. What is? There are a few I’d like you to consider with me briefly.  1) God already knows our “secret sins.” However adept we may be at “hiding” our sins from others, He knows not only our actions, but also the innermost thoughts and desires of our hearts, Hebrews 4:12-13 .  2) We all have sins for which we need forgiveness. While we certainly may have sinned against others, and need seek their forgiveness, every sin we commit is against God and demands His forgiveness first and foremost, 2Samuel 11 ; 12:12-13 .  3) Perhaps most importantly, there are no sins too big or too numerous for God’s grace, 1Timothy 1:14 . He has promised Christians that if we will confess our sins to Him, and repent of them, He will “cleanse us from  all  unrighteousness,”  1John 1:6-10 .  All of which should cause us to better understand His grace , mercy , and love ; and to be so very thankful for His willingness to  remember our sins no more   ,  Hebrews 8:12 !"],"title":["Just Imagine"],"_resultNumber":37,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/just_imagine","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":37},{"body":["I usually avoid using the term \"crisis\" because it is so vastly over used, but...."],"title":["The Crisis of Compromise: “Conflict Resolution”"],"_resultNumber":38,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/the_crisis_of_compromise_conflict_resolution","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":38},{"body":["What causes it? Even better, what prevents it? The basis of this article is a piece done by a denominational fellow about the failure of his own denomination to grow. He gives some very insightful causes of this abject failure.  Or perhaps better asked: What can we do to ‘cause’ church growth? It is readily admitted that this may still not be the “right” question and/or that this may not be the right way to put it. It may well be that we should first realize that when we learn, understand, and practice what God’s Word teaches, numerical growth is neither the goal nor the responsibility of “us.” Our duty is obey whether numerical growth occurs or not. That being said, certainly most all congregations want to grow– some spiritually, most numerically, and a few want both. Growth is God’s natural order for all things living. It was once well stated that “If a church is not growing, something is preventing it.” (Homer Hailey) About this, he was exactly right!   So, whether right or wrong, we agree that most congregations want to grow in some way and feel that they have to do something to cause it to happen. To what have these desires led? Wrong motivations usually produce wrong methods. Likewise, wrong objectives almost always produce wrong motivations and wrong methods. To illustrate the point, please notice something I ran across the other day while researching a different subject. It is an article written by a denominational fellow and regards growth, or the lack of it, within his denomination. He asks and answers a very interesting and insightful question. The name of the denomination has been omitted as it is not important to the point I’m making. Please consider carefully his implied conclusions:   “Consider the matter of the growth of ________. Usually the subject is approached from the positive point of view. “How shall we grow?”  View the subject from the other direction—“How did _________ not grow?” What are some of the courses which may lead to mediocrity if not to oblivion? Several suggestions may be listed:  1. Practice open church membership—this will devaluate our ________ position. 2. Disregard the Scriptural meaning of, and invitation to, the Lord’s Supper—this will cheapen communion. 3. Play down the importance of baptism—this will stifle our testimony. 4. Emphasize ecumenicity—this will erase our distinctiveness. 5. Be apologetic regarding the use of the name “_______”—this will weaken our prestige. 6. Deny direct kinship with the New Testament Christians—this will cut the root of Biblical and doctrinal strength. 7. Minimize the importance of training—this will close the churches on Sunday evenings. 8. Take the side track of fanatical conservatism or radical liberalism—this will produce a series of splinter groups. 9. Solicit financial support from non-_______—this will make beggars of the churches.  There are other roads which might open the way to denominational nothingness, but this combination would probably make others unnecessary.” —Robert G. Lee    Mr. Lee is very perceptive….and right! These things have produced the “denominational nothingness” which has led to spiritual impotency. Oh sure, there are churches with growing memberships through some of these methods– but the sad fact is that they have not produced increasing numbers of committed, dedicated, Christians! And they never will.  While we strive to maintain the non-denominational character of Christ’s true church, may we learn from the mistakes of others (and unfortunately, plenty of miscues of our own as well!) and avoid the pitfalls of improper motivation and method.

Tillit S. Teddlie, who was, in my opinion, one of the greatest authors of our hymns. His songs are singable, melodic, and always seem to carry a thought-provoking and or inspirational message. Such is certainly true of this great anthem. But my question is this: \"Is it really true for you?\" Or otherwise stated, \"Can you honestly and enthusiastically sing this particular song?\"    I fear we (meaning most church members today) are far too comfortable here. I fear we do not “groan, longing to be clothed with our dwelling from heaven” in ways Paul expressed to Corinthians as “walking by faith, not by sight” ( 2Cor.5:3,7 ). Why? Because we do possess the sentiment Bro. Teddlie penned in the opening line of the song: “Earth holds no treasures but perish with using…” Most of us have far too many “treasures” here. I don’t mean that we are too wealthy or possess too much, though that may be true enough, but that we have far too many things here that we “treasure.” Our storehouse of “treasure” is not in heaven as Jesus said it should be, cf. Matt.6:19-21 . The treasures of earth, rather than those of heaven, occupy our hearts. What is the evidence of such a claim?    Think about it for a moment. When you pray, do more spiritual or physical concerns populate your prayer? I’m not suggesting that physical concerns be eliminated, obviously James 5:13ff indicates we should pray with regard to such things. But which group gets more of petitional concern from you? When spiritual duties such as worship are set aside, how often is it done for physical pursuits that are not necessities, such illness, or truly unavoidable circumstances? If your checkbook (or bankcard) and Bible were both taken without your knowledge, which would you miss first? Unfair question? Perhaps so, but it does make us stop and think about which we use (and value?) more often doesn’t it?    But perhaps the most obvious indicator of where our true “treasure” might be is seen in our attitude toward physical vs. spiritual life. A physical cold gets our attention immediately, but spiritual heart problems often go ignored for years despite the symptoms being just as obvious.

This is due, in part, to the general tendency of women to live longer than men. But even among the younger populace of congregations, there are again usually more females than males. I’m not exactly sure why this is so, but for whatever reasons, women generally seem to be more accepting of the gospel and spiritually-minded than men. While this is certainly a commendable reflection upon the fairer sex, it surely doesn’t bode well for the male of the species! So, what can be done to improve the spiritual-mindedness of us guys? Consider three representative types of men: the Lady’s Man, the Man’s Man, and the My Own Man .   Samson surely possessed all the physical traits the ladies sought in a man. He had long flowing hair ( Judges13:3-5 ). He had big muscles and tremendous strength ( 14:6; 15:14-15; 16:13 ); and he had unmatched athletic prowess and fighting skills ( 14:19; 15:4,8 ). Yet despite these physically attractivetraits, he also: had a horribly failed marriage ( 14:20–15:6 ); had a penchant for prostitutes ( 16:1-3 ); wound up living alone in a cave for a while ( 15:8 ); finally took his own life along with 3,000 Philistines ( 16:28-31 ). Though blessed by God with wonderful physical attributes, which apparently made him very attractive to the ladies, Samson failed to be a godly man, and he also failed to be the leader God wanted him to be. He may have been a ladies’ man, but he failed to be God’s man.   Saul had the man’s man pedigree for leadership- he was from the courageous tribe of Benjamin ( Judges 20:15ff ), and his father was “a mighty man of valor” ( 1Sam.9:1 ). He also was blessed with an imposing physical stature that made him look like a natural leader ( 9:2 ). And unlike Samson, Saul, at least initially, possessed great humility ( 9:21 ). He had the support of the people and the valiant men of Israel ( 10:23-26; 11:15 ). The men wanted someone else to do their fighting for them ( 8:20; 12:12 ), and Saul appeared to be just the man for the job. He was a true man’s man: tall, strong, and capable ( 11:5-11,15 ). But there was a chink in Saul’s amour. It seems that the absolute power of the monarchy corrupted him almost absolutely. He took on himself the role and responsibility of performing sacrifices ( 13:8-13 ). This was neither his place nor prerogative. He further substituted his thoughts for God’s instructions concerning the destruction of the Amalekites ( 15:3, 7-9 ). And when his failures were brought to his attention by Samuel, he denied, equivocated, and blamed the people ( 15:10-21 ). Surely this was not the conduct of a godly leader. Saul may have been a man’s man, but miserably failed to be God’s man.   Solomon was wise and wealthy enough to have it all- and that was exactly what he had-everything. “And all that my eyes desired I did not refuse them. I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure…” ( Eccl.2:10 ). Solomon became his own man! The details of his self-pleasing efforts are abundantly evident ( vv.3-9; 1Kings 11:1-3 ). He thought only of himself and the pleasure he could attain. But ultimately, this pleasure-seeking desire to be “his own man” led him away from God, “For it came about when Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart away after other gods…Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the Lord…” ( 1Kings 11:4,6 ). Though blessed with wisdom, health, and wealth, this king of Israel was ultimately rejected as the leader of God’s people ( v.11 ). He may have been his own man, but failed to be God’s man.  So what does it take to be God’s man ? You don’t need beautiful hair, big muscles, athletic prowess, good looks, large stature, or great wisdom or wealth. You do need a godly heart (of love for Him), a godly mind (filled with knowledge of His Word), and godly determination to live for Him (rather than for women, other men, or yourself). Now, whose man do you want to be? Our families need godly husbands and fathers to lead in the home; our community needs godly citizens and businessmen to lead in it; and our churches need godly men to lead in them. Will you become a godly leader, or, are you content being led by ungodly desires of women, ungodly desires of other men, and/or your own ungodly desires?  The Southside Church of Christ (602 Henderson) will be conducting a class on Becoming  Godly Men & Leaders each Thursday evening at 7:30 for the next several weeks. There is no cost or further obligation, and all males from high school age up are invited.

This is true with regard to how the constituent elements of our physical being work in concert to determine our conduct. Think about the following carefully, please….  Do your  feelings  dictate your actions, and then your thoughts have to try to rationalize what has already been done?  Do your  actions  simply react to stimuli without really thinking or feeling anything- at least until afterwards? Or,  Do your  thoughts  determine your actions, and your feelings then emanate from them?  Obviously, we all function in all of these various ways from time to time. There are occasions when we react emotionally without really thinking through the consequences. There are other times when we simply act impulsively without any real emotional or intellectual incentive. But hopefully, there are also times when we act only after deliberate consideration. While we may not be able to completely divorce our thought processes from emotional influences- nor should we necessarily, it is important that our heads come first in the “chain of command” to determine our actions rather than our hearts. Why is this true?  Hearts, and the emotions that come from them, are fickle things. They often vacillate widely from one extreme to the other, usually from temporary and external influences. “Following ones’ heart” thus often becomes a very winding road with many switchbacks and complete course changes. To illustrate this point, think of small children. One moment they’re crying almost uncontrollably, and the next they’re giggling equally uncontrollably. Why? They are immature, and are thus easily influenced by temporary and external motivations. This is exactly how they should function since they are, after all, children. But as we mature, the intellect is supposed to gradually take over the controlling influence of our activities from our emotions. Cognitive and reasoning skills should begin to override purely emotional decisions, which are really reactions rather than decisions anyway. This process is called “maturation,” or more simply, “growing up.”  These things have specific application value in our spiritual growth and development. Consider Jesus’ words of Matthew 5:39 , “But I say to you, do not resist him who is evil; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.” First, please understand that a “slap” is an insult, not an attack on personal safety. But more importantly, who is able to fulfill Jesus command? Is it the person whose emotions dictate their reaction to a personal affront, or the one whose deliberate thought considers the ultimate good of all concerned before reacting? The first is a purely emotional reaction born of spiritual immaturity that will likely return “evil for evil,”  see v.38 ; while the latter is a thoughtful reaction born of spiritual maturity which provides testimony to the offender and glory to God, see vv.40-48 .  Look at another application from James 1:19 , “This you know, my beloved brethren. But let every one be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.” If we are spiritually immature, we might be inclined to react to this verse with, “I can’t do that- it’s just not who I am; I just say what’s in my heart, and if others don’t like it, that’s just tough.” But again, let’s think this verse through a bit before discounting it as an impossible goal. First, God says, “be quick to hear.” This involves a readiness to not only listen, but to hear and consider. Such implies thoughtful consideration of what is heard, rather than an immediate emotional reaction to it. Second, God says to be, “slow to speak.” This hesitancy to instantaneously respond to what has been heard gives the brain, which typically functions a little slower and more cautiously than the heart, time to process and digest what has been said so that an intelligent (rather than emotional) and productive response can be given. And third, God says to be, “slow to anger.” While anger might indeed be the righteous response to what has been heard, such should only come slowly after careful deliberation has been given to not only what was actually said, but also to what actually should be said in response. Thus, the emotion should follow the thought and the action, rather than precede them.  If we can learn to put our emotions after thoughtful consideration and appropriate action, we will be a lot more pleasing and productive in the kingdom because we will have spiritually “grown up.” We’ll feel better too because the right “horse” (of our intellect) will be pulling the cart of our activities instead of them being pushed by the “mule” of our emotions!"],"title":["Think, Act, and then Feel"],"_resultNumber":42,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/think_act_and_then_feel","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":42},{"body":["“Hearing voices” can be an indication of mental illness or mental health- it all depends on the voices and what they say. For instance, “voices” that urge you to: hurt yourself or others; do things morally reprehensible; or act in ways contrary to sound logic and reason are obviously problematic whatever their source. But what about “voices” that instead urge you to: help yourself and others; act in morally upright and righteous ways; and conduct yourself in reasonable, logical, and sound courses? What “voices” do this?   The Voice of Inspiration.   “All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work,”  2Timothy 3:16-17 . Are you listening to the voice of inspiration for the education and correction it provides to enable you to be useful to God in your life?   The Voice of Reason.   “I urge you there, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship,”  Romans 12:1 . The word translated as “spiritual” in this verse can also be rendered as “rational” (and is given as an alternate in the margins of some versions). What does this mean? It is not only spiritual, but also reasonable to listen to and obey God by living sacrificially for Him instead of selfishly for yourself. Are you listening to His voice of reason in this way?   The Voice of Knowledge.   “I know, O Lord, that a man’s way is not in himself; nor is it in a man who walks to direct his steps,”  Jeremiah 10:23 . There is an obvious arrogance involved when we think we know more or better than our Creator about anything. So, when facing problems and difficulties, or just seeking to navigate through the mazes of life, do you listen to the ultimate voice of knowledge, or assume you have/can get all the needed information yourself?   The Voice of Understanding.   “For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, declares the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts higher than your thoughts,”  Isaiah 55:8-9 . Think about it- there are so many times and circumstances in life that cause us to admit, “I just don’t understand.” But, in how many of those times and circumstances do you appeal to God in prayer for assistance AND look to His word for enlightenment? We may tend to ask for His help, but usually fail to search the answers He has already provided for assistance. Are you listening to the voice of understanding by trying to “see” things the way God does?   The Voice of Wisdom.   “Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom. But if you have bitter jealous and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth. This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but earthly, natural, demonic. For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing. But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy. And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.”  James 3:13-18 . Thus, “true wisdom” is only present when the “right” things are done through it. Are you listening to the voice of wisdom “from above” in righteous conduct, or still struggling to find peace through the wisdom from below (human sources)?  Why not listen to and heed these “voices”? To be sure, there are myriads of “voices” which claim to be those of reason, knowledge, understanding, and wisdom today. However, there is but one voice that really counts- the voice of inspiration! Read your Bible- it contains the reason, knowledge, understanding, and wisdom that matters to eternity."],"title":["Hearing Voices"],"_resultNumber":43,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/hearing_voices","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":43},{"body":["There is a huge difference between being patient and being dead , obviously. This is true physically and spiritually- which is equally apparent. In our last article, the importance of “patient faith,” and trusting God and His ways, was emphasized through the story of Abraham and Sarah. Eventually, as we learned, they stopped trying “help” God (through adoption and surrogacy ) fulfill His promise to give them a son. Instead, Abraham and Sarah finally learned to patiently trust and obey God. He then, in turn, blessed them with Isaac, the son He had promised. But…  Being “patiently faithful” and trusting in God did not mean that Abraham and Sarah just sat down and waited for God to fulfill His promise of “giving” them a child! While there is no need to be crass or crude, Romans 4:18-21 makes it clear that although Abraham’s body was “as good as dead,” his faith was very much alive and well. “In hope against hope he believed, in order that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, ‘So shall your descendants be.’ And without becoming weak in faith, he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb; yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief, but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully assured that what He had promised, He was able to perform.” Simply put, Isaac was not born by immaculate conception. However, Isaac’s conception is not really the point.  The point is that while Abraham and Sarah’s faith became “patiently obedient,” such does not mean that they did nothing and just waited for God to act in their behalf. They were, instead, faithfully obedient to God’s promise and each other in the matter. All of which also illustrates the principle so plainly taught in James 2:17 , “Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.” If their faith had not led them to be active participants, God would have never blessed their efforts with the child, Isaac. Surely we can see the implications of these things in regard to the “blessing” of salvation. Is salvation a “gift” from God? Absolutely, “For by grace have you been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast,”  Ephesians 2:8-9 . But please also consider this question: Was Isaac a “gift” from God? Again, the answer is “absolutely,” cf. Genesis 15:2,4 and Romans 4:17 . However, we must acknowledge that the “gift” of Isaac by God did not preclude Abraham’s active participation in order to receive it. If we can see this with Abraham’s faith in receiving God’s gift of Isaac, why can’t we see it in regard to our faith requiring active participation in order to receive God’s gift of salvation? Especially when this is one of the points being made in Romans 4 ?  However, there is another application of these things that needs to be made. As we now understand that God’s grace combines with our active and obedient faith to provide salvation, we must also comprehend that just arriving at the point of salvation from sin is not the end of the matter. After becoming saved by grace and faith, we do not then just patiently await Christ’s return while doing nothing. Surely this “dead faith” of the sort described in James 2:14-26 , and does not result in eternal salvation, vv.24,26 . In fact, James uses Abraham to illustrate this point in v.23 , “and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, ‘Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,’ and he was called the friend of God.” Having now understood that Abraham’s faith was rewarded with the gift of Isaac only when he acted in accordance with God’s will, can we not also see that the same is true for us in our continued walk of faith? We are not assured of salvation just by an initial act of obedience, but by continual acting in faith according to God’s word, “Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?”,  v.21 .  What’s the bottom line? None of us will be eternally saved by God’s grace without faith. But this faith that saves by God’s grace is also active and obedient while patiently waiting for God to carry out His purposes through us."],"title":["Patient Faith versus Dead Faith"],"_resultNumber":44,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/patient_faith_versus_dead_faith","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":44},{"body":["When God promised a son to Abraham and Sarah, they were already old. But they had some faith, so they believed and waited- for a while anyway. However, they eventually decided to “help” God fulfill His promise. They first purposed to adopt the eldest son born in their household (the son of a servant) so that he could become the promised heir. God said this wasn’t the way. So they again waited, at least until Sarah decided she might be the problem, and gave her handmaid to Abraham as a wife so that the heir could be born through her. God reiterated His promise that Abraham and Sarah would have a son. So again, they waited. Then, as promised, Isaac was born, and the nation that was to come from the aged couple had its beginning. What has any of this to do with “The Power of God to Save”?  God said His “power to save” was invested in the gospel. The apostle Paul wrote, “For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation ….”  Romans 1:16 . Perhaps the impatient faith of Abraham and Sarah has some modern equivalents in this regard. Do we really believe and trust God’s word regarding the real power of salvation enough to just keep preaching and teaching the gospel? Or do we instead, like Abraham and Sarah, doubt just enough to be enticed to “help” God accomplish His purposes through our own means and methods? Have we forgotten where God invested His power to save? Is our faith truly strong enough to just obey God and trust Him for the rest?  If our faith is insufficient or impatient, we will turn to and emphasize other means and methods (rather than preaching and teaching the gospel) in feeble attempts to bring the lost to salvation. For instance, we might adopt the fellowship plan of using food and fun to “help” God save the lost: “We’ll attract them with what they want, and then give them what they need later.” Or, we might attempt to meet the physical needs of the lost in order “help” God save their souls: “We’ll help them find a spouse, or educate or entertain their children, then we can teach them the truth.” Or, we might be tempted to use a business model to sell salvation to potential lost customers to “help” God: “In the business world, we do it this way, and it works there- it ought to work to save the lost too.” Or, we might modernize worship so that it appeals to more people in order to “help” God save the lost: “People today want modern music, drama, theatrical lighting, and a worship performance that uplifts their spirits- let’s give them what they want to get them here, then we can teach them the gospel.” Or, (please fill in the blank).  There are a couple of obvious problems with the solutions proposed above. 1) God didn’t provide any of these “solutions” in the Bible. They all come from well-meaning men who had the best of intentions, but who also had impatient faith that lacked trust in God’s word. 2) God said the power of salvation was in “the gospel” rather than in any of these means or methods, “For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation….”  Romans 1:16 .  So, what is the solution? The world is full of souls- including yours and mine, which need the salvation Jesus offers. There is but one real solution, “Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction,”  2Timothy 4:2 . We must return to the Word! We must preach it, we must teach it, and we must exemplify it by living it. The gospel is God’s power to save! We must “give attention to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation and teaching,”  1Timothy 4:15 . While reading the Scriptures in public places is great, Paul was talking about the public place of worship! If the lost are to be saved, our sermons must be filled with “God’s power to save,” rather than being crammed with sacrosanct rhetoric, hypothesized theology, humorous anecdotes, pop-psychology, and the testimonies of celebrities. Let’s start trusting God instead of impatiently trying to “help” him with our ideas and methods.

Perhaps this is an over-simplification, but it is the difference between being “active” and being “acted upon.” Many believe that man is entirely “passive” in regard to his own salvation- that he is “acted upon” by God, and has very little, if any, “active” responsibility himself. Let’s see if this is how God saved Noah in the very first case of salvation. Please consider the Word of God with me:  · The world was exceedingly wicked, and God decided to “blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land…”  Genesis 6:5-7 . So far, so good. What’s next?  · “But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord,”  Genesis 6:8 . The word translated “favor” is also accurately rendered as “grace” in some versions. What was it about Noah that set him apart from the rest of the wicked world in the eyes of God?  · “Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his time ; Noah walked with God,”  Genesis 6:9 . It certainly appears that God’s grace was manifested toward Noah because of his righteous obedience to God, in which case Noah was certainly not “passive.” OK, so what did God’s grace do for Noah?  · “Then God said to Noah, ‘The end of all flesh has come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence because of them; and behold, I am about to destroy them with the earth.” The first thing God’s grace did for Noah was to warn him of the coming destruction of the flood. OK, what else did God’s grace do for Noah?  · “Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood….” (God’s grace then gave very specific instructions on exactly how to make the ark), Genesis 6:14-16 . So, the second thing God’s manifested grace did for Noah was to tell him how to prepare for the coming destruction. What else did God’s grace do for Noah?  · “But I will establish my covenant with you….” (God’s grace also gave additional specific instructions regarding who and what Noah should take with him into the ark- his family, animals, and provisions), Genesis 6:17-21 . So, how did Noah respond to God’s manifested grace?  · “Thus Noah did; according to all that God had commanded him, so he did,”  Genesis 6:22 (see also Genesis 7:5 ).  · Then came the rain, and the ensuing flood, “And all flesh that moved on the earth perished, birds and cattle and beasts and every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth, and all mankind; of all that was on the dry land, all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died,”  Genesis 7:21-22 .  Now, let’s recap. Was Noah saved by “grace”? Absolutely! God’s grace warned him of the coming destruction, and told him how to be saved from it. Does Noah’s salvation by grace mean that he was entirely “passive” in regard to it? Having a trusting faith that was willing to: believe God regarding “things not yet seen” ( cf. Hebrews 11: 7; i.e. rain,  Genesis 2:5-6 ); obey God by gathering enough gopher wood to build an ark 450 feet x 75 feet x 45 feet, furnish it with a year’s provisions for yourself, your family, and representative animals of the earth; and then to enter and stay in that ark for a year certainly does not sound “passive,” does it? God surely saved Noah by grace, but such did not exclude Noah’s active obedience in the process. Noah did not “earn” salvation by his works, but he certainly did have to obey God’s commands in order to be saved by His grace.  In response to these things, we might be prone to say, “But that was prior to Christ- we are saved differently today.” Are we? Let’s consider what the apostle Paul wrote, by the inspiration of God, about grace and salvation some 30 years after the death of Jesus, “For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, instructing us to deny ungodliness  and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously , and godly  in the present age , looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus; who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds,”  Titus 2:11-14 . We are saved by God’s grace just like Noah: it warns us of a coming destruction of judgment, and tells us what to do in order to be saved from it! “…the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through by water. And corresponding to that, baptism now saves you…”  1Peter 3:20-21 . Salvation is not simply not “passive”- in fact, as we’ve learned from Noah, it never has been."],"title":["Is Man Passive or Active in Salvation?"],"_resultNumber":46,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/is_man_passive_or_active_in_salvation","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":46},{"body":["Let’s start with some hopefully not-too-boring-but-accurate definitions of terms. “Denominational” is a word used to describe a church which is bound by association to an outside organizational headquarters. How much control is exercised over local congregations by the parent headquarters varies from one denomination to another. “Inter-Denominational” is exactly what the word implies- a church comprised of members from various denominations. Such congregations often disavow controlling outside influences from denominational headquarters, but typically retain some standards, practices, and teaching of them internally. However, inter-denominational groups usually think of, and refer to themselves as “non-denominational,” despite the continued acceptance of their concepts and doctrines. By contrast, truly “non-denominational” congregations shun all denominational control, practices, organizations, and teaching. Each congregation is instead completely autonomous ( self-governed ), and therefore, what is taught and practiced is determined within the local congregation itself. Furthermore, in this “non-denominational” arrangement, there is no structure above or beyond the local church; there are no earthly “headquarters” or outside “organizational associations.” Now, the big question: Which of these arrangements is correct? The question is easily answered by a simple search of the New Testament to see which one God ordained. Let’s see what the Book says....   Ephesians 4:4 , “There is one body….” Since Ephesians 1:22-23 identifies “the body” as “the church,” having multiple denominations all teaching and practicing different things is not the biblical plan or arrangement. While some seek to use 1Corinthians 12:12ff to authorize the existence of many divergent denominations because the passage speaks of differing “parts of the body,” a careful reading of the context reveals that Paul is actually saying that the  local congregation  is “the body” in this case, and its distinct “parts” ( i.e. the foot, eye, hand, etc. ) are the  individual members  , see vv.12-27 . Simply put, Christ built “one” church, and expects everyone to be “one” within it. “I do not ask in behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through their word; that they all may be one…”   John 17:20-21 . Multiple “denominations” (which implies division ) teaching and practicing different things, but all claiming to follow the Bible, was never the intention of Jesus. Instead, Christians were exhorted “by the name of Jesus Christ, that you all agree , and there be no divisions among you, but you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment,”  1Corinthians 1:10 .  Additionally, the “denominational” arrangement has another significant problem. The New Testament simply does not authorize any organization larger than the local congregation. Local congregations are to be led by overseers, bishops, elders, or pastors- which all refer to the same office according to Acts 20:17,28 (the terms are used interchangeably). These overseers must meet the qualifications for the office as given in 1Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:7-9 . Furthermore, their oversight is clearly limited to the local congregation in which they have become qualified, 1Peter 5:2 ( “shepherd the flock of God among you ” ). There is just no provision in the New Testament for a separate board of directors, council, or denominational headquarters. Each congregation is to be led by a plurality of elders (more than one, according to Acts 14:23 ) who take the Bible as their only creed, and teach and practice what it dictates.  What about the “inter-denominational” arrangements? The problem with “inter-denominational” is that it either: 1) accepts denominational biases and practices despite differences, instead of insisting on unity through “book, chapter, and verse” authority; or, 2) forces the compromise of convictions for the sake of ecumenism (acceptingdivergent beliefs and practices despite contrary personal conviction). Neither of these consequences agree with scripture. “If there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion, make my joy complete by being of the same mind,  maintaining the  same love , united in spirit, intent on one purpose,”   Philippian 2:1-2 .  What have we learned? The New Testament teaches that God’s ordained arrangement of the church, and its subsequent congregational government, requires: 1) local autonomous groups; 2) led by multiple overseers who meet the specified qualifications; 3) and lead the congregation according the Bible only; 4) without the additional control of external boards or associations. Anything else (or more!) just can’t be found in the New Testament, and thus is an arrangement of man rather than God."],"title":["Denominational, Inter-Denominational, and Non-Denominational"],"_resultNumber":47,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/denominational_inter_denominational_and_non_denominational","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":47},{"body":["Some 700 years before the time of Christ, God’s prophet Isaiah warned of the foolishness and futility of idolatry in clear and remarkable language the logic of which cannot be denied. In Isaiah 44 , he first points out that although a man may plant a tree (or forest), it is God who sends the rain that makes it grow in v.14 . But the reasoning of the next few verses is amazing. The man depicted cuts a tree from this forest and: 1) burns some of it to build a fire for warmth; 2) burns some of it to bake his bread and roast his meat; and, 3) “But the rest of it he mak es into a god, his graven image. He falls down before it and worships; he also prays to it and says, ‘Deliver me, for thou art my god’,”  v.17 . The point is crystal clear: Why would anyone worship and pray to a “god” he himself fashioned from the same tree that he also burned to warm himself and to cook his food? Moreover, why would anyone reasonably expect such a “god” to deliver him from trouble or oppression?  The apostle Paul makes pretty much the same point to the idolatrous Athenians in Acts 17:29 , “Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and thought of man.” Man, as the creation of God, surely should not think that he could create a “god” that is worthy of his adoration and worship!  While there are surely still people in the world who carve a “god” from wood, or form one from some other substance, such are not the most common forms of idolatry today. Instead, many worship the idol of:   Their Own Desires , “For many walk, of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose god is their appetite, and whose glory is in their shame, who set their mind on earthly things,”  Philippians 3:18-19 . The alternative marginal rendering of the word translated as “appetite” is “belly.” He’s not talking about gluttony necessarily, but instead refers to making our own selfish desires into a “god,” and obeying them rather than Jehovah. In reality, this is nothing more than self-worship, and is the height of idolatry.   Mammon,  “No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and Mammon,”  Matthew 6:24 . The rampant consumerism and commercialism of the current world surely must be the result of worshipping Mammon (riches) rather than the Messiah. If you’d like to know if you’re worshipping this particular idol, read the rest of Matthew 6 ( vv.25-34 ), and then ask yourself this question: “Do I really believe and worship God enough to truly ‘seek first His kingdom and His righteousness,’ or is He just a distant second (or third, fourth, etc.) place in my life to money and the things it will buy?   Pleasure,  “If because of the Sabbath, you turn your foot from doing your own pleasure on My holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy day of the Lord honorable, and shall honor it, desisting from your own ways, from seeking your own pleasure, and speaking your own word, then you will take delight in the Lord, and I will make you ride on the heights of the earth; and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken,”  Isaiah 58:13-14 . These words were meant to contrast right and wrong attitudes of worship, and to condemn the idolatry of “pleasure,” to God’s people under the Law of Moses. The Sabbath, God’s “holy day” under that law system, was being corrupted and/or pushed aside for the selfish pursuits of personal pleasure. Though the first day of the week is the day of worship for Christians under the Law of Christ (rather than Saturday/Sabbath, cf. Acts 20:7 ; Revelation 1:10 ), the problem of this particular idolatry persists today. In fact, it may well be the most prevalent form of idolatry practiced. God’s “day” has instead become God’s “hour” for many- and only then if it doesn’t conflict with some other recreational activity or preferred pursuit. Surely, such is idolatry.  Will you worship your Creator, or instead bow to the idols you create of your own desires, money, and pleasure? The latter makes no more sense now than it did when Isaiah wrote about it some 2700 years ago!"],"title":["The Futility of Idolatry"],"_resultNumber":48,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/the_futility_of_idolatry","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":48},{"body":["When Jesus entered the temple in Jerusalem and began to drive out the merchants and money-changers, He said, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer;’ but you are making it a robber’s den,”  Matthew 21:13 . What would the Savior say today upon walking into modern structures claiming to be houses of God? Would He consider them houses of prayer , or something else? Would He likewise call them “robber’s dens” because they house those using “religion” as a place of hiding while taking others’ money? Or would He just call them a:     “House of    Players, ” due to their emphasis on athletic teams and sports-related activities? In 1Corinthians 9:24-27, Paul used athletics as an example to teach the importance of: obeying the rules,  v.24 ; self-control,  v.25 ; and avoiding disqualification,  vv.26-27 ; but he did so to teach spiritual lessons, not to authorize church sporting events or athletic programs.    “House of    Payers, ” since those in charge always seem to be asking for more money? There are two issues here requiring attention: 1) the authorized collection of funds; and, 2) the authorized expenditure of funds. 1Corinthians 16:1-2 authorizes only free-will collections on “the first day of every week”- not “tithing,” or asking for money every time there is an assembly. Secondly, churches typically need more and more money because they have more and more programs to support, which are usually not authorized by the N.T. in the first place. Obviously, there are expenditures associated with securing a place to meet for worship and study, but beyond this, what else does the N.T. authorize? The N.T. church used collected funds to support needy saints locally and elsewhere,  Acts 4:32-35 ; Romans 15:25-27 ; and to financially support those preaching and teaching the gospel locally or elsewhere,  1Corinthians 9:12-13 . That’s it- period. If churches today would collect and spend money the way the N.T. authorizes, perhaps less would be needed.    “House of    Programmers, ” as there is a seemingly endless supply of new ones? (This house is often a duplex with the House of Pay! ) 1Timothy 3:15 records, “I write so that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of truth.” Paul was giving Timothy inspired instructions on how churches could and should be the purveyorsof God’s word. Read Timothy- both letters to him, and the rest of the N.T. to see if the “programs” which seem oh so “necessary” to us, were a part of God’s plan for the church. If they are not found in God’s word, they’re not only unnecessary; they are probably also a violation of God’s will.    “House of    Pantomimes, ” because the people inside are pretending to be something they’re not? Paul, again, stated it pretty clearly, “But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith,”  1Timothy 1:5 . Churches filled with people honestly endeavoring to possess and further develop these qualities aren’t “playing church,” nor are they hypocritically attempting to “keep up appearances” of piety while living sinful lives, cf. 2Timothy 3:1-7 . They are, instead, the very opposite of such- true Christians sincerely striving to please God above all else.    “House of    Pluralism, ” because the notion that there is one  body, Spirit, hope, Lord, faith, baptism, and one God ( Ephesians 4:4-6 ) has become foreign to them? “Pluralism” exists when people are together in some association, but each maintains his own traditions, beliefs, and interests; such is clearly not the Lord’s way for “His” house, cf. Philippians 2:1-2 . And yet, hungry for memberships at all costs, many churches have cast aside the truth of God’s word for what will be acceptable to or popular with the masses. Thus, they stand for nothing and bow to everything.  Why not clean house, and return God’s house to being one of  prayer   , rather than one of  players, payers, programmers, pantomimes,  and  pluralism?

Despite having a “tie” that binds us together, true “unity” often does not really exist. So, we act and treat one another about the same as we imagine our illustrative cats would, and the fur flies- and unbelievers have a more difficult time understanding why they should become Christians, cf. John 17:21 .  These things beg two important questions: 1) How do we become united; and, 2) how do we stay united? Let’s take them one at a time.  How do believers  become  united with one another in Christ? Let’s see what the Bible says about the first “church” fellowship in Acts 2 . How did they become “united”? They had a:    -Common Birth/Salvation  . “So then, those who had received his word were baptized; and there were added that day about three thousand souls,”  v.41 . How could any group of individuals hope to have true unity if there was not a common entrance into the relationship they claim to share? They were all previously “united” under the bondage of sin, v.36 ; and they were all told to do same thing in order to receive the forgiveness of their sins, “Repent, and let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins…”  v.38 . So, they shared a common birth into Christ by repentance and baptism (see also 1Corinthians 12:13 ).    -Common Devotion/Worship   . “And they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, and to the breaking of bread and to prayer,”  v.42 . For these new Christians to be “continually devoting themselves” to the “apostles’ teaching,” they had to come together in an assembly. Thus, the devotions mentioned in this verse seem to indicate the acts of worship through which they were united- apostles’ teaching (hearing the Word) , fellowship (it means joint participation ) , breaking bread (communion) , and prayer (public/congregational). Simply put: They not only shared a common birth by belief, repentance, and baptism, they shared a common devotion of worship based on the instructions of the apostles. They were all born the same way, and they all worshipped the same way- as God said.    -Common Emotion/Feelings   .“And everyone kept feeling a sense of awe…”  v.43 . Proper and mutual emotion in religion is not derived from contrived worship performances; it is achieved by being family (of the same birth ), and being joined together in mutual devotion (of worship) to God. Then, because we are family, and worship together the same Father in the same way, our hearts are blended together in common emotion for Him and one another. This kind of emotion will result from doing the right things in the right ways together.     -Common Effort/Work   .“And all those who had believed were together….”  vv.44-47 . Their common birth, worship, and emotion also led to a fellowship of selfless service. Each stopped being so caught up with self, and began working together for God’s purposes and helping each other. As a result, they worked together, ate together, studied together, and praised together. Basically, they became united!  How do believers  stay  united in fellowship with one another in Christ? Note what Paul wrote to the brethren at Philippi on the subject, “by being of the same mind , maintaining the same love , united in spirit , intent on one purpose ,”  Philippians 2:2 . To stay “united” with other believers in fellowship, our minds, hearts, and souls must come together in the  single    intent  ofpleasing God, v.13 . How is such accomplished? Look again to the text: 1) “do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit,”  v.3a ; 2) “but with humility of mind let each of you regard one another as more important than himself,”  v.3b ; 3) “do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others,”  v.4 ; and, 4) take on the attitude and activity of Christ Jesus, vv.5-8 . While other things, such as having the same “platform” of unity are involved (see Ephesians 4:4-6 ), the key to achieving and maintaining unity is simple: Read the Bible, and do what it says, when it says, how it says. To become truly united, we must put away our own egos, ideas, and desires and come together on a “thus sayeth the Lord!”"],"title":["Unity"],"_resultNumber":50,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/unity","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":50},{"body":["For the literate person, the ability to read and write is typically learned so gradually while younger, that it is largely taken for granted. The literates, therefore, can’t imagine what it’s like to not be able to read or write because they can’t really remember not being able to do so. But think about it for a moment, what if you couldn’t read or write? How dramatically different would your life be? Oh sure, you could still communicate verbally, but in our technology-dominate and information-driven world of today, how severely would your life be limited? Illiteracy, if uncorrected, is obviously a problem that greatly hinders one’s opportunities for success in life. But…    Spiritual   illiteracy , like the regular type, also greatly hinders one’s opportunities for success in life. However, spiritual illiteracy, if uncorrected, is a problem that also leads to everlasting torment. Please consider two passages in this regard. Ephesians 3:3-5 , “that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. And by referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ…”.  2Thessalonians 1:7-9 , “…when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire, dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. And these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power.” From these verses, two things become abundantly clear relative to our topic: 1) Spiritual enlightenment is dependent upon our willingness to understand the gospel of Jesus Christ by reading it for ourselves: and, 2) Those unwilling to come to the knowledge of God, and obedience to His gospel, will be eternally lost.  So, if it is your intent to forfeit the eternal destiny of heaven by remaining spiritually illiterate, here are a few tips to help accomplish that goal:   Don’t learn the order of the books of the Bible. This way, you’ll have difficulty looking up passages for yourself to see whether the things are so that someone else told you about the text, Acts 17:11 . Thus, your faith will always be dependent upon someone else’s understanding of, and accuracy with, the Scriptures.   Don’t learn the basic division between the Testaments. This way, you’ll never really understand that the “Old” Testament, while inspired and important, was given to those of the nation of Israel living before the death of Christ, or that the “New” Testament became God’s law for everyone after that point, Hebrews 8:13 ; 9:1-17 . Thus, you’ll never be able to “handle accurately the word of truth,”  2Timothy 2:15 .   Tell yourself that the Bible is too big and confusing for you to understand. This way, you’ll feel much better about leaving any real understanding and application of it to “the experts.” Question: How many “theologians” did Jesus select to “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature,”  Mark 16:15 ? But, if you tell yourself that the Bible is too big and confusing for you to understand, one thing is certain: you will never try to do so. And thus, you will remain spiritually illiterate regardless of the number of experts consulted.   Tell yourself that no one really understands the Bible anyway. This way, at least you’ll feel better now about refusing to read and study a book that God inspired and provided to lead you through life to heaven, 2Timothy 3:16-17 ; Romans 10:17 . And, don’t bother yourself with the fact that saying “no one really understands the Bible anyway” indicts God as being unable to provide understandable instructions to man whom He created, and wants to save.   Convince yourself that you don’t really have time to study and learn the Bible. This way, all the time spent on social media, watching television, recreation, relaxing, and doing all the other more desirable things won’t seem like such a waste by comparison. None of those things will teach you how to live in such a way as to be welcomed into heaven after death, but at least you’ll have “fun” while you’re here, Luke 16:19-31 !   Refuse to attend the readily available and free multiple classes that are offered at your local church each week that are specifically designed and delivered to help you understand God’s Word. This way, you can continue to do a lot with that extra two hours each week besides reading and studying the Word of God together with those who want to learn, understand, and live it, Acts 20:32 .

Some obviously do so more than others. At times, we use these mental tactics on other people, perhaps to gain an edge over or influence them in some way. However, most of our mind gaming efforts are expended on ourselves, and for the same reasons. We play these games on or with ourselves in an effort to manipulate or influence our own thinking to do or not do something that our heart wants, or to excuse or justify what we’ve already done. What do I mean? See if these examples sound familiar…  The “Is It Really Wrong?” Game. We actually already know the answer to this question; we just don’t want to accept the answer. So, we play this mind game and pose the question anyway hoping for some way to excuse or justify the activity because it is what we want to do. The subtle serpent Satan got Eve to play this game in Genesis 3:4-6 .  The “It Isn’t A Big Deal” Game. We usually play this game after playing “Is It Really Wrong?” game and realizing that the answer is still “yes.” So, rather than just admitting defeat and accepting that we shouldn’t do what we want to do, we switch to this game. Notice that this game admits the activity is wrong (and therefore shouldn’t be done), but seeks to justify the activity anyway by claiming that this particular “wrong” activity is somehow “less wrong” than other “wrong activities.” Romans 6:23 doesn’t use this (or allow) this method of classifying sin.  The “It Won’t Hurt Anything Just This One Time ” Game. This game also is usually played after the previous two have been played and lost. The desired activity is still desired despite the previous defeats, so we move on to this game. Notice the progression: the activity is admitted to not only be “wrong,” but also to have harmful consequences; but, the object of this game is to justify the wrong activity anyway by claiming that its harmful consequences only ensue after repeated offenses. Uzzah probably would not agree with that conclusion, 2Samuel 6:6-7 (his life was taken because of a single offense).  The “It’s Not Hurting Anyone Else” Game. There is progression, or more precisely, digression, again. Now we’re admitting that the desired activity is wrong, and that it has harmful consequences, but are still clinging to the desired activity anyway by claiming that it is only harmful to me, and therefore does not affect anyone else. While there may be some “private” sins that don’t affect anyone else, such is not really the point. The “private” rather than “public” consequences of a sinful activity do not make it any less sinful or consequential for the player personally. There is no real “win” when playing this game, Romans 6:16 .  The “It’s Not Really Who I Am” Game. This particular game claims that a “win,” which means going ahead and doing/justifying the desired activity despite admitting that it is wrong, contradicts the outcome. In other words, it claims that committing sin doesn’t make one a sinner. Ezekiel 18:26 surely seems to say otherwise.  The “I Can Quit Anytime I Want ” Game. Note that playing this game concedes defeat in all the previous ones. It admits the desired activity is wrong, has harmful personal consequences, and that it makes the participant a sinner destined for destruction. But, playing it bolsters the notion that desire is all that is necessary to stopping a sinful activity and altering our future course. Millions of addicts would strongly disagree, and so does the Bible, Matthew 27:3-5 .  The “I’ll Straighten Up Later” Game (aka, the “Wild Oats Game ”). This one is very much akin to the previous game. It is based on the premise that each person has some allowed quota of sin before “growing up.” Galatians 6:7-8 proves this premise to be completely false.  The “I’ve Already Gone This Far” Game. The idea behind this game seems to be that “If one sin can condemn me, I might as well go ahead and get my monies’ worth while I’m at it.” There are many problems here, but perhaps the main one is that the more “wrong” turns we make, the harder it is to get back to the “right” road. By playing this game, we surrender to defeat. What if Paul had played this one, cf. 1Timothy 2:15-16 ?  The “It’s Too Late For Me Anyway” Game. This is the ultimate surrender mind game we play with ourselves. It admits total defeat and is unwilling to even continue the struggle against sin. But again, IT’S BASED ON A FALSE PREMISE! If a denier of the deity of Jesus and persecutor of the church can repent and become a preacher of righteousness, so can you, 1Corinthians 15:9-10 .  Don’t play mind games with yourself- defeat is the only outcome, and your soul is at stake.

Then she pretends not to recognize me and asks, “What’s  y our   name?” It’s OK, I deserve it- and then some. But there is another side to this brief saga....  When I do something that nearly 29 years of marriage have taught her to expect from me, she says, “I   know   your name!” This is usually pretty much the inverse of the previous things mentioned: the not-so-good, not-very-gracious, or the certainly- not-extra-nice things, like burping loudly after eating way too much of a meal consisting entirely of meat smothered with gravy, hogging the remote, or refusing to attend a play or some other “artsy” event with her. Then she portends to  know  my name because I am being consistent to the character my previous actions have led her to expect from me.  Both sides of these exchanges are all in good fun, and we typically get a good laugh from them. She’s a great lady who tries hard to take care of me in spite of my bad habits and poor tendencies, and I love her dearly for it. But, there is a spiritual point to these things….  It’s generally assumed that last names evolved to distinguish people with the same first names. These last names were often derived from a person’s occupation. Thus, John the blacksmith became John Smith. As Christians, we take on the name of Christ- our avocation (one’s passionate endeavor )as opposed to our vocation (one’s job), when we become spiritually united with Him through faith and baptism, Galatians 3:26-27 ; Ephesians 5:22-33 . So, our conduct and character ought to be consistent with our name, right?  I can’t help but wonder if the Father above ever looks down at me and says, “What’s  y our   name?” because my actions are surprisingly, and in a good way, out of character? This could only occur if I had previously consistently conducted myself in a way that was inconsistent with the name “Christian” that I professed to wear. Certainly, God knows anything and everything He chooses to know ( cf. Genesis 11:5; 18:21; 22:12 ), so I’m certainly not doubting or disputing His omniscience. I’m just supposing “what if” to make a point. God, like my wife, could easily ask me, “What’s  y our   name?” when I’m doing what is good if such is actually out of character for me!  Conversely, but to the same point, God could also say, “I   know   your name!” if I continue to act as I always have, despite the fact that I know better, and that such activity is contrary to the name “Christian” I profess to wear. This is also known as rebellion, or “sinning willfully,” and has its own particular set of consequences, cf. Hebrew 10:26-31 .  Now, what would God say about  y our   name in light of the consistency of your character and conduct? “Little children, let no one deceive you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous; just as He is righteous; the one who practices sin is of the devil….By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious; any one who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother,”  1John 3:7,8,10 . “What’s  y our   name?” or “I   know   your name!”- which is it for you?"],"title":["“What’s YOUR Name?”"],"_resultNumber":53,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/whats_your_name","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":53},{"body":["“For what will a man be profited, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?”  Matthew 16:26 The Lord’s point, if I understand it correctly, is that there is no physical thing with which a man may buy back his forfeited soul. However, the context also makes it clear that the spiritual personal purchase price (in addition to the obvious sacrifice of Jesus, v.21 ) of one’s soul is self-denial, self-sacrifice, and true discipleship,  v.24 . However, let’s consider the Lord’s words from a slightly different perspective to see if it will help us come to a better understanding of these things.  While there is indeed no physical thing that a man  can  give in exchange to  purchase  his soul, there are several physical things that we  do  give in exchange to  forfeit  them ( cf. Hebrews 3:12ff ).   We exchange material needs and desires  for our souls. In Luke 14:16ff , Jesus told a parable where the offer of salvation is compared to “a big dinner” to which many had been invited. Notice that the first invitee exchanged the invitation (for the salvation of his soul) for the need he felt to look at land he had purchased, v.18 . How often the needs we feel for material things (possessions) are exchanged for our soul’s salvation! Jesus warned against this in Luke 12:15 , “Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not even when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions.” It is so easy to become wrapped up in the pursuit ofthe material things of life- things moths and rust destroy or that thieves steal ( Matthew 6:19-20 ), that we wind up exchanging the priceless value and eternal permanence of our souls for them.   We exchange business pursuits  for our souls. Back in the parable of Luke 14:16ff , the second invitee exchanged the invitation to his soul’s salvation for the opportunity to try out ten oxen he had recently purchased. So, his new tractor (important in an agrarian-based society) came before his soul. The Scriptures certainly teach that we should be industrious rather than lazy when it comes to providing for ourselves ( 1Thessalonians 4:11-12 ), our families ( 1Timothy 5:8 ), and even others ( Ephesians 4:28 ). But, the Bible also teaches that we have to keep our priorities straight, and always “seek first His kingdom, and His righteousness; and all these things will be added to you,”  Matthew 6:33 . “Work” is a physical necessity, but not to the exclusion of the spiritual needs of our souls! Don’t exchange “the bread which comes down out of heaven” to feed and save your soul for the “manna in the wilderness” of this world, cf. John 6:48-51 .   We exchange family connections  for our souls. Look one more time to Jesus’ parable in Luke 14:16ff . The final invitee to the feast excused himself from the benefits of attending because he had “married a wife,”  v.20 . Marriage is certainly honorable ( Hebrews 13:4 ), and our families certainly deserve our love, respect, and attention ( Ephesians 5:22-32 ; 6:4 ). But, even they cannot be allowed to take precedence in our lives over our God and our souls. Jesus plainly said that “He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me,”  Matthew 10:37 . And yet, how many people have exchanged their souls for the love of their families? How many precious souls are forfeited for “family ties”? Some forfeit their souls by following a spouse away from God and into sin. Some forfeit their souls by rejecting the truth they know for the family they love who are unwilling to abide in it. We are supposed to love, respect, and obey our families, but never more so than we do God, for in so doing we exchange our souls for family connections.  There is truly nothing that we can give in exchange for our souls in the sense of buying them back- Jesus alone is that redemptive purchase price, 1John 2:2; 4:10 . But there are many things, including the “passing pleasures of sin,”  Hebrews 11:25 , that we may and do give in exchange for our souls in the sense of forfeiting them. Your soul is the most precious thing you will ever possess. Jesus died to buy it back (redeem it) from sin. Don’t make that sacrifice worthless by exchanging anything for your soul!"],"title":["What Will You Give in Exchange for Your Soul?"],"_resultNumber":54,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/what_will_you_give_in_exchange_for_your_soul","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":54},{"body":["Most Christians recognize that God entrusts parents with the spiritual education of their children. This was true under the Old Law ( Deuteronomy 6:6,7 ), and is equally true under the Law of Christ ( Ephesians 6:4 ). From the passage in Ephesians, we recognize that the burden of this responsibility falls squarely on the shoulders of fathers as the spiritual leaders in the home. At the same time, we understand that mothers have the obligation to aid their husbands in the spiritual development of the children ( Genesis 2:18 ).  Certainly, because of our deep respect for God and His will, we should be diligently devoted to the cause of teaching our children about Him. Furthermore, because we fear standing in judgment with the shame of having neglected our responsibility, we are compelled to be fervent in our efforts ( Matthew 25:14-30 ).  We also recognize another factor that should lead us to be serious in this regard. Peter says we must be sober and vigilant because of the destructive efforts of our adversary ( 1Peter 5:8 ). We need to recognize the truth of this statement, and not be ignorant of his schemes ( 2Corinthians 2:11 ). Satan knows the best way to destroy a community, state, or nation as a whole, is to begin in the home by striking at the very core of what makes any economy successful. Thus, parents must be careful not to allow him a foothold to deceive them into thinking other things are more important. They must ever be reminded of the importance of making spiritual matters a priority in their own lives ( Matthew 6:33 ), and imparting those truths to their children.  With that said, it is crucial for parents show devotion in teaching their children. Furthermore, it is imperative that they recognize where they are most effective in this endeavor. Too many parents rely on bible classes to meet the pressing needs of their children. While it is true bible classes are very beneficial toward this end, it must be recognized that these, at best, are simply a supplement to the teaching that takes place in the home. In other words, bible classes, as good as they are, will never be as beneficial to our children's spiritual education as will our efforts as parents to daily communicate to them the importance of serving God ( Deuteronomy 6:6,7 ; Psalm 34:11 ).  No doubt, there are parents today who take this responsibility seriously, and make spiritual education a priority. I have seen firsthand the efforts made by godly parents to train their children in the ways of God, and also the result of these efforts as their children grow to develop their own faith. To these parents, Christianity is not just a show, or something to be taken lightly. It is a lifestyle, and an obligation born out of their love and respect for God, and for the Savior who loved them enough to die for them.  Is this the attitude we have? Are we making spiritual education in the home a priority, or do we neglect this responsibility? Are we so focused on helping our children excel in secular activities that spiritual training gets swept aside? Are we so self-absorbed that we make no time to show love for our children in this regard?  Let me assure you, those devoted to the Lord place the emphasis where it needs to be. They recognize the fact that they will have these blessings in their trust for only a few short years. As a result, they make the most of the opportunity God gives them.

This pattern exists in the physical (particularly animal ) world, but unfortunately, rarely follows in the spiritual world of those claiming to be Christ’s church. Why is this? Could it be that they are not nearly as spiritually “alive” as they presume themselves to be? Perhaps so, but there are also other key reasons…   Some churches don’t grow because  they are made up of members who are not growing. Local congregations are made up of individual members. If most of the members are spiritually immature and not growing themselves, the congregation won’t grow for a simple reason: Reproductive growth is the product of spiritual maturation. If church members are not growing individually, they will not mature sufficiently to be spiritually reproductive. Spiritual reproduction, just like physical reproduction, is accomplished by the mature rather than the immature. Consider carefully this question: What is the real point of addingthe so-called “Christian Graces” of 2Peter 1:5-7 to your faith? Is it to make you an example of faith to be admired and respected? That may indeed happen, but such isn’t the stated reason. This growth surely assures the individual of continued faithfulness and eternal life, vv.10-11 ; but notice also that v.8 provides an additional purpose. “For if these qualities are yours and increasing , they render you neither useless nor unfruitful in the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.” Those who grow to maturity are “useful” because they  bear fruit  (which in keeping with the metaphor, contains even more reproductive seed )! And, let’s not forget or misconstrue John 15:1-8 on this particular point either.   Some churches don’t grow for the simple reason that they do not understand spiritual reproduction (growth) as a personal responsibility. When we comprehend that things are supposed to happen, we generally work toward that objective. Somewhere along the line, churches have forgotten, or have not been adequately taught, that it is the job of every Christian to reproduce themselves spiritually. It is God’s will for each saint, Colossians 1:25-27 ; 2Timothy 2:2 . This is how the early church grew so dramatically, Acts 8:1-4 . And, for far too long we have ignored the fact that Matthew 13:6,23 , the part about the good ground bearing fruit   of 100, 60,  and  30 fold  , is the point of the parable of the Sower! Spiritual reproduction is the job of every Christian. Churches comprised of members that don’t take this personal responsibility to heart die sooner or later- it is just a matter of time.   Some churches don’t grow due to the false notion that Christian “maturity” is determined by time rather reproduction. When a “mature Christian” is contemplated, most folks generally consider the length of time one has been a Christian as the main component. While spiritual maturity definitely has a time element to it ( cf. Hebrews 5:12 ; 1Timothy 3:6ff ), there are far too many Christians that are considered to be “mature” just because they have been Christians for a long time. Why isn’t spiritual reproduction considered? Plants, animals, and people are considered “mature” when they have grown sufficiently to reproduce. But somehow, and for no good reason, in the spiritual realm we never seem to think in these terms. Consider this: When we understand that our child is not growing at a normal rate, we start paying closer attention to the factors that produce growth to maturity like nutrition, exercise, and freedom from disease. Like the life cycles mentioned in the opening paragraph, these growth factors translate from the physical to the spiritual. The same types of factors that produce physical growth have their spiritual counterparts. So, if spiritual growth is not occurring, and because of it spiritual maturity is lacking, there is likely a deficiency in one or more of the factors that typically produce it: spiritual nutrition ( 1Peter 2:2 ) ; spiritual freedom from disease ( 1Peter 2:1 ) ; orspiritual exercise ( Hebrews 5:11 – 6:1 ). If a Christian isn’t growing sufficiently to mature and spiritually reproduce, something is wrong. To change this, we must stop thinking of spiritual maturity as only relating to time. “Growing up” spiritually also has to do with taking on the mature responsibilities of spiritual reproduction. This mindset must change for sustainable growth to occur.  While there are other factors that surely inhibit the growth of churches, it is hoped these can help us to think and act in ways that will ensure that the Cause of Christ not only survives, but thrives in and through growing local congregations."],"title":["Why Churches Don’t Grow"],"_resultNumber":56,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/why_churches_dont_grow","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":56},{"body":["The front of our lot has about a ten-foot high bank that runs the length of the street frontage. While the bank is sloped enough to mow lengthwise, it is fairly steep. At the bottom of the slope there is a curb. Since there is a considerable grade that runs upward from the curb to the level ground above, runoff is a problem. But the main issue is that the grass (and weeds) and dirt are always spilling over the curb and clogging up the drainage gutter. So, at several times a year, I have to cut/edge and shovel off the excess dirt, and the grass that seemingly grows faster there than anywhere else. I hate this task. It’s hot, dirty, and hard work; and that dreaded curb seems to be a mile long.  To make the job at least a little easier, several years ago I bought a shovel specifically to use for this task. It’s a fairly large square shovel with a long heavy-duty handle. Since the sides of the shovel were sloped outward, it didn’t work very well. It kept hanging up on and digging into the bank as I slid it down the length of the curb to clean off the cut grass and dirt. So, I took the shovel out to the shop and slightly heated one side of it with a torch. Then I laid it on the anvil, and reshaped the edge with a hammer until if formed a 90-degree angle. Feeling pleased with that improvement, I opted for another one. I also heated the tang (hollow part of the shovel blade where the handle attaches) and carefully bent it to one side. This modification would allow the shovel to be more comfortably used from the gutter, instead of having to keep one foot up on the curb or bank. With these improvements, the shovel worked well for several years. But this year, a new problem arose.  While cleaning that dreaded and seemingly mile-long curb yet again, my modified shovel kept getting tired, and I would have to let it rest for several minutes at a time to keep it from overheating! I guess it’s gotten old, weak, and just doesn’t work very well anymore. Maybe it’s time to replace it- “I think I need a new shovel.”  Do we use this same kind of obviously flawed logic with regard to the spiritual “tools” God has given us? Reasoning that is so lacking in self-awareness as to be unwilling to consider that the real culprit might not be the “tool” but the “operator?” While it is true that my curb shovel has, over the years of use, become kind of dull and dented in a few places, it’s nothing that a little care and maintenance wouldn’t solve. So, please consider that…  A  new bible   , even an electronic one, will “work” no better than the old one unless the “operator” uses it enough to become proficient with it. 2Timothy 2:15 , “Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, handling accurately the word of truth.”   A  new church  will likely soon be discovered to have many of the same “problems” as the old one unless the “goer” becomes actively invested and involved enough to help solve them. Philippians 2:12-13,16 , “So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure… holding fast the word of life...”   A  new bible class program  probably won’t be any “better” than the old one unless it has “prepared” teachers and “regular” students who desire to learn. 2Timothy 3:14-15 , “You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them; and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.”   Tools do sometimes need modification and maintenance to function properly, or even better. But, no “tool” works without a dedicated, prepared, and proficient “operator.” This surely includes the  spiritual  tools God has given us- like the Bible, local congregations, and bible classes. Sometimes it is the “operator” instead of the “tool” that is dull, dented, and thus, doesn’t work well. The “shovel” may indeed need sharpening, but the “operator” still has to be willing and able to “work” for things to get done right and well."],"title":["“I Think I Need A New Shovel”"],"_resultNumber":57,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/i_think_i_need_a_new_shovel","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":57},{"body":["Medals are awards that typically, and somewhat ironically, are made of soft metals- perhaps even cheap metals that are then plated over with a shiny metal or coating substance. This is ironic because the  mettle  (courage, bravery, determination, spirit, grit, resolve, guts) that is required to achieve a  medal  worth having is often not made of a truly representative  metal  .  Our society likes to be rewarded. We like trophies and medals. What we don’t like quite so much is the hard work, self-discipline, and dedication ( i.e. “mettle”) it takes to make the reward of a trophy or medal truly meaningful. Instead, we prefer to “pay our money” and get a “participation award”- which likely means that we paid more in dollars than we participated with devotion. Such “medals” (trophies/awards) are meaningless and should be made of unpolished lead.  Heaven is a spiritual place composed of spiritual things given as an eternal reward to the souls of spiritual people. As such, streets of gold and gates of pearl (see Revelation 21:18-21 ) are images meant to convey the splendors of this eternal reward, rather than literal representations. So, while the rewards of heaven are spiritual rather than physical, they are nonetheless real, and abiding in the presence of God for eternity is certainly the foremost among them, cf. John 14:1-3 ; Revelation 21:3-4 !  Paul spoke of the eternal reward of heaven as “the crown of righteousness” in 2Timothy 4:8 . This is the eternal crowning “medal” of heaven. There are some interesting contrasts between it and the “trophies” of this life:  · This “medal” is not a “pay your money and receive a participation trophy” kind of thing. Anyone who knows anything about the life of Paul knows this. This “medal” cannot be bought with money. “But whatever things were gain to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ,”  Philippians 3:7 . Simply “cutting a check for weekly/annual dues” won’t attain this honor, and neither will just “making the meetings.”  · This “medal” is actually worth far more than anything and everything sacrificed to attain it. Note again Paul’s words to the brethren on this point, “But more than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish in order that I may gain Christ,”  Philippians 3:8 .  · This “medal” is forged not with common “metals” of most, but with the “mettle” of the  knowledge  (of Jesus through His word),  spiritual regeneration  (through faith and rebirth by baptism),  suffering in fellowship  (as a Christian), and becoming  dead to sin and the things of this life  (as was Christ). Paul, again, highlights these “mettles” from his own life to the brethren in Philippi, “and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith, that I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,”  Philippians 3:9-10 .  · This “medal” is a “lifetime achievement award” whose benefits exceed the lifetime- “the resurrection from the dead,”  Philippians 3:11 . While the reward is eternal, its criteria is very much in the here and now.  All of this brings us back to the passage where we began, 2Timothy 4:8 and the “crown of righteousness.” The context says that this “medal” is given to those with the “mettle” of self-sacrifice, spiritual combat, perseverance, and mission accomplishment. Note the previous two verses in these regards, “For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith,”  2Timothy 4:6-7 . Will you be able to say the same at the end of your life? Will you receive the same “medal”? No, unless your “mettle” now is of the same kind as his."],"title":["Medal, Metal, and Mettle"],"_resultNumber":58,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/medal_metal_and_mettle","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":58},{"body":["But it usually makes us proficient- especially when practicing sin. The word “practice,” like many words, can be used as either a noun or a verb. As a noun, “practice” refers to an activity that is repeated until it becomes a habit. As a verb, it refers to the repeated rehearsal for the activity itself. Thus, sin can become our “practice” (noun) if we “practice” (verb) it diligently and consistently.  In Ephesians 2:1-2 , Paul included himself when he described some who “walked according to the course of this world” and “lived in the lusts of our minds, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind” to such an extent that they became “by nature children of wrath.” Becoming “by nature children of wrath” clearly does not refer to a genetic predisposition to sin, or some otherwise inherited sinful nature, because he emphasizes personal activity and indulgence as being the cause. So, there are sinful choices being made and practiced. What is being highlighted in the text is the principle that repeated indulgence of fleshly desires through sinful practices changes our habitude ( native or essential character ). We do not become sinners by being born that way, cf. Ezekiel 18:20ff ; we become sinners when we chose and “practice” the “works of the flesh” over the “fruit of the Spirit,”  Galatians 5:16-26 .  The more often that we make the choice to “practice” (verb) sin, the easier and faster it becomes our “practice” (noun). Just like any other activity, repetition leads to proficiency. Whether turning a double play on the baseball diamond, or baking a cake in the kitchen, repetition makes us better at performing the activity. It is no different with sin. By repetition, we learn what “works” best for us. We learn how to better hide the activity from those we know will disapprove. We learn how to better salve our consciences with excuses and justifications. And, we learn how to better mitigate any concerns of spiritual conscience, and minimize the physical consequences that may accompany the sinful practice(s). Thus we become proficient at sin by practice. And since we typically enjoy and indulge in the activities at which we become proficient, sin becomes easier, and therefore also becomes more and more the “practice” (noun) of our lives.  But thankfully, the same principles of practice apply in the other direction too. Just as we become more proficient at sin by practice, so too we can become more proficient at righteousness by practice! When we first decide by faith and repentance to live godly rather than sinful lives, the “practice” of righteousness is decidedly difficult. Like a baby learning to walk, there are many falls, bumps, and bruises along the way. 1John 1:8-10 makes it clear that sinful mistakes are just simply part of the process of learning to “walk by faith” ( 2Corinthians 5:7 ). But just like practicing sin, practicing righteousness leads to proficiency, and proficiency makes our walk of faith easier. There is no trick to it, and there are no short cuts. It just takes “practice”- diligent, repetitive, consistent, and concerted practice. The good news is that anyone can do it. If we genuinely want to please God by turning from the “unfruitful deeds of darkness” ( Ephesians 5:10-11 ), are willing to study and learn the playbook ( Ephesians 3:3-5 ) , and are willing to really dedicate ourselves through diligent “practice” ( Ephesians 4:11-16 ), then we can “walk no longer as the Gentiles walk” and “be renewed in the spirit of your mind” and “put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth” ( Ephesians 4:17, 23,24 ).   1John 3:4-10 , “Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. And you know that He appeared to take away sins; and in Him there is no sin. No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him. Little children, let no one deceive you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, that He might destroy the works of the devil. No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin because he is born of God. By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious; anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother.” Our “practices” (verb) determine our “practice” (noun)."],"title":["Practice May Not Make Us Perfect…."],"_resultNumber":59,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/practice_may_not_make_us_perfect","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":59},{"body":["Spiritual illiteracy and immaturity are certainly related, but not identical. While spiritual illiteracy is a cause of spiritual immaturity, it is not the only one. What else can one do to keep themselves spiritually immature?   Be too busy with work, recreation, relaxation, or other activities to attend worship and bible classes regularly . Obviously, it helps greatly with spiritual illiteracy and immaturity to occupy yourself with as many other discretionary activities as possible to avoid as many opportunities as possible to increase your knowledge of God and His word, Matthew 6:19-34 .   Be too busy with work, recreation, relaxation, or other activities to spend your discretionary time with brethren who may encourage you, or whom you may encourage, outside of worship or bible class . This way, you won’t be bothered with “other people’s problems,” and can devote all of your worry time toward your own selfish pity party, which helps dramatically with spiritual immaturity (because this is the way a spiritual two-year old acts), Hebrews 12:1-17 .   In the times you do attend worship services or bible study, insist on being spoon-fed all the spiritual nutrition you consume. Never make any effort to follow along in text, and never take any notes about things you can go back over later, or study more on your own. And, never make any preparations beforehand for bible class to be able to contribute to the discussion, or ask or answer any questions beyond the obvious ones, 2Timothy 2:15 and 2Peter 3:14-16 .   Be unwilling to consume anything but spiritual baby food (the sweet and easily-digestible kind) .  Refuse to eat (spiritually speaking) anything that doesn’t taste or feel familiar, you know, like everything you’ve always consumed previously. This will rule out trying anything new or more challenging. And don’t forget to insist on “sound-bite” solutions to every biblical passage, question, or application- even the difficult ones. This will also keep you in the “milk” rather than the “meat” of the word, Hebrews 5:11 – 6:2 .   Refuse to exercise your spiritual muscles so that they can grow and become strong. After all, if you were to become spiritually strong, it could mean that others might become dependent on you, or you might be called upon to do some “heavy lifting” in the kingdom. No, spiritually immature is the way to go to avoid responsibilities and keep everyone’s attention focused on you. So, by all means, refuse to grow in the ways 2Peter 1:5-7 describe, and for the reasons 2Peter 2:8-11 outline.   Keep yourself perpetually spiritually sick through constant exposure to, and indulgence in, sinful activities. Refuse the treatments the Scriptures (and those who teach them) provide, and instead spend most of your time with those already completely infected with sin. They will help to insure that the spiritual weakness of your immaturity develops into a full-blown case of sin so that spiritual death can ensue, Romans 6:12-16 and 2Timothy 2:21-26 .   Convince yourself that spiritual growth and development really isn’t necessary. After all, you’ve done what is necessary to become a “child of God”- isn’t that enough? Never mind the obvious comparisons between physical and spiritual organisms- that those who don’t grow out of infancy die. No, go right ahead and convince yourself that growth and development really aren’t necessary to spiritual survival. To help assure you of this fallacy, completely ignore 2Peter 3:17-18 and Ephesians 4:11-16 .  See? Remaining spiritually immature is actually pretty simple and easy. We just have to keep doing many of the same things we’re already doing! “Him we proclaim, warning and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that we may present everyone  mature  in Christ,”  Colossians 1:28 (ESV)."],"title":["How to Keep Yourself Spiritually Immature"],"_resultNumber":60,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/how_to_keep_yourself_spiritually_immature","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":60},{"body":["This is not some sort of rehash of “cleanliness is next to godliness”- which, by the way, is not actually in the Bible anyway. Instead, it is an attempt to highlight a doctrinal principle with an example from everyday life.  A few days ago, I came home to find my dear wife mopping the living room floor. While such is not very glamorous, it is an apparent necessity at my house to prevent having pot-less house plants sprouting right there on the tile floor! How does all that dirt get into the house?  Since the boys have both moved out, I can no longer blame those crumb-snatchers-covered-with-dirt (and noise!) for tracking it in from outside. Perhaps Donna is bringing it in? No, she’s much too clean for that; and we don’t have pets either. So, though I am certainly a believer in Special Creation over of the Theory of Evolution, I am forced to the seemingly inescapable conclusion that dirt must be spontaneously generating itself inside our living room! It has to be, since it seems that Donna sweeps and mops constantly, but then the very next day there is more of it. I can think of no other plausible explanation (he says with tongue heavily imbedded in cheek)!  Does all of this sound familiar? I don’t mean the self-cause denials of a husband part; I mean the bit about the perpetual presence of dirt despite repetitive cleaning. All that dirt in the house actually has a primary source: people living there. Dirt in the house is a fact of life, not unlike the presence of sin in our lives. Roman 3:23 says, “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” This doesn’t mean that we have to sin, just that we all have done so. Lest we think we’ve become so “clean” that the dirt of sin is no longer a part of our lives, consider 1John 1:8 , “If we say we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” It is worthy of note that John was writing to Christians who had become “clean” by the blood of Christ through their obedience to the gospel, cf.1John 2:12 . And yet, they too had spiritual “dirt” in their lives.  So, what do we do about the “spiritual dirt” of sin in our lives? Some say that once we become Christians, we can’t become “dirty” enough with sin as to be eternally lost. However, this contradicts what the Bible plainly says in Hebrews 3:12 , “Take care, brethren , lest there should be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart, in falling away from the living God.”  It also contradicts clear examples of the same in Acts 1:25 (Judas), and 8:12-13, 18-23 (Simon).  Others say that Christ’s blood “continually cleanses” the Christian from any and all sins he may commit in the future. If by this it is meant that sins committed after becoming a Christian are “automatically” forgiven, the Bible again contradicts, since such surely wasn’t the case for Judas, or Simon, or even the apostle Peter (Cephas) in Galatians 2:11 . In fact, the Christians in 1John 1 were told, “  If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness,”  v.9 .The presence of the conditional “if” in the sentence requires activity on our part to be forgiven when we sin. We must, therefore, acknowledge the sin to God, and repent and pray for forgiveness, Acts 8:22 . All of which is far from “automatic,” or “continual” cleansing!  Thus, sin in our lives as Christians is kind of like dirt in the house: it’s probably going to be there; and, we’re going to have to keep doing what is required to get rid of it! We can’t just ignore it, or say that it isn’t really there, and expect it to go away."],"title":["“Dirty Floors and Clean Lives?”"],"_resultNumber":61,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/dirty_floors_and_clean_lives","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":61},{"body":["A comedian by the name of Bill Engvall has been making people laugh (and making what I imagine to be a good living too!) for several years by telling “Here’s your sign” stories. The common thread of these stories is the apparently unavoidable tendency we all share to say or do things from time to time that are just plain…. well, stupid. And when we say or do these foolish things, someone is invariably there to hear or see them, and, of course, bring to our attention just how ridiculous we sound or look. Engvall’s signature tagline to such occasions is, “Here’s your sign”- meaning that someone ought to hand us a “Stupid” sign to wear so that others will know to approach or engage us with caution!  Such is the basis of his humor- and it’s funny to us precisely because it is familiar. Most all of us have “been there” and “done that.” Being able to laugh at ourselves, and see the funny side of the really dumb things we say and do, is probably good, and certainly supplies some healthy humility to our egos. We all need someone to help us really see ourselves clearly- to tell us the truth about our identity.  Actually, there is somewhat of a biblical parallel to these things. Under the Law of Moses, a person infected with leprosy was required to cry out “Unclean! Unclean!” to those who approached so that they could avoid close contact with him, cf. Leviticus 13:45 . This is likely why those men in Luke 17:12-13  “stood at a distance” from Jesus and called out to Him. Though certainly the horrors of an incurable disease are not to be made light of by comparing them to a comedic device, the principle is the same as Engvall’s suggested sign: to let others know you might be dangerous to them!   Given these things, perhaps there are other “signs” which would be helpful as identifiers and warnings to others if we would wear them, like….  A “Liar” sign would let everyone know not to trust us. “Oh, but I’m not really a liar, I just stretch the truth a little sometimes.” Well, all that won’t fit on the sign! Besides, Ephesians 4:26 says, “Therefore, laying aside falsehood, speak the truth, each of you, with his neighbor, for we are members of one another.”   A “Thief” sign would certainly be helpful. That way, everyone would know not to leave valuables unprotected if such a sign-wearer was around. Or, we could all just heed Ephesians 4:28 , “Let him who steals steal no longer; but rather let him labor, performing with his own hands what is good, in order that he may have something to share with him who has need.”   An “Adulterer” sign could be very beneficial also (yeah, I know- there was a book and a couple of movies about this one). After all, it would be easier than wearing multiple signs since an adulterer has “lied” regarding the contract made with his mate, and has “stolen” someone to whom he did not have a right, cf. Matthew 14:3-4 . Or, we could just honor God’s rule of marriage: “One man, one woman, for life,” Matthew 19:6,9 .  Do these things sound too harsh? The truth is we could  all  have multiple signs identifying our own sins, cf Romans 3:10-18,23 . Though we may have all earned the right to wear one (or many) of these signs at one time or another, there are other signs we could wear that would also be helpful to those around us, like….  A “Washed” or “Sanctified” or “Justified” sign could help others to more clearly “see” us, and Jesus’ saving power. 1Corinthians 6:9-10 identifies a whole host of folks who “shall not inherit the kingdom of God.” This list includes, along with several other sins, liars, thieves, and adulterers. But, the very next verse ( v.11 ) adds, “And such  were  some of you; but you were washed, you were sanctified , but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.”   The great news is the Corinthians changed signs! And you can too- just “ be baptized and wash away your sins”  as Paul did in Acts 22:16 ; cleanse yourself from dishonorable things and “pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace” so that you can be  “sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work”  as in 2Timothy 2:21-22 ; and by these things become justified- “for not the hearers of the Law are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified,”   Romans 2:13 . So, if you have to wear a sign, make it one of these!"],"title":["“Here’s Your Sign”"],"_resultNumber":62,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/heres_your_sign","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":62},{"body":["This article is not \"Evidences\" oriented, but rather considers a much more basic motivation for Bible belief.  To be quite blunt, we believe many things in life because we want to! While this is a far cry from validation on several fronts, it does help to explain a few things about human beings. Sometimes, we believe things that we want to believe in spite of evidence or wisdom to the contrary. This is exactly the charge some make toward those today who believe the Bible as God’s inspired word. They suggest that the Bible is for simpletons who simply want to believe in something, therefore it is believed contrary to higher thought and evidence. Really? While it is admitted that there are some things that folks believe in this way and for such reasons, it is denied that Christians believe the Bible for these reasons. As supportive evidence, note the quotes listed below from noted men of philosophy, science, and literature on their estimation of the Bible:   Dr. William Lyon Phelps, noted educator, “… I thoroughly believe in a university education for both men and women; but I believe a knowledge of the Bible without a college education is more valuable than a college course without the Bible.”   Sir Walter Scott, on his deathbed, “Bring me the Book!” When asked what book, he replied, “There is but one Book!”   Dr. Schurman, President of Cornell University, “The Bible is the most valuable document in English literature. No man can be called an uneducated man who knows his Bible and no man can be called an educated man who does not know his Bible.”   Andrew Jackson, “That Book is the rock on which this republic rests.”   Thomas Jefferson, “I have always said, and will always say, that the studious perusal of the sacred volume will make better homes, better citizens, better fathers, and better husbands.”   Abraham Lincoln, “I am profitably engaged in reading the Bible. Take all of this book upon reason that you can and by the balance of faith and you will live and die a better man.”   John Quincy Adams, “The first and almost the only book deserving of universal distinction is the Bible. I speak as a man of the world to the men of the world and I say to you, ’Search the Scriptures’.”   Daniel Webster, “If we abide by the principles taught in the Bible our country will go on prospering, but if we and our prosperity neglect its instruction and authority, no man can tell how sudden a catastrophe may overwhelm us and bury us and our glory in profound obscurity.”   Theodore Roosevelt, “Almost every man who has by his life work added to the sum of human achievements of which the race is proud, almost every such man has based his life work largely upon the teachings of the Bible.”   Woodrow Wilson, “A man has deprived of the best there is in the world who has deprived himself of a knowledge of the Bible.”   Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France, “Behold it upon the table. I never fail to read it, and every day with the same pleasure…. Not only is one’s mind absorbed, it is controlled and the same can never go astray with this book for its guide.”   Lord Roberts, “You will find in this book guidance when you are in health, comfort when you are in sickness and strength when you are in adversity.”   Isaac Walton, English author, “Every hour I read you it kills a sin or let a virtue in to fight it.”   Jean Jacques Rousseau, French philosopher and author, “I must confess to you that the majesty of the scriptures astonishes me;…. if it had been the invention of man, the invention would have been greater than the greatest heroes.”   Charles A. Dana, American journalist, “Of all books the most indispensable and the most useful, the one whose knowledge is the most effective is the Bible. There is no book like the Bible. In every controversy the Bible contains the right answer and pleads for the right policy.”   John Ruskin, “Read your Bible. Make it your daily business to obey it in all you understand. To my early knowledge of the Bible I owe the part of my tests for literature.”   Immanuel Kant, German metaphysician, “The existence of the Bible as a book for the people is the greatest benefit which the human race has ever experienced.”   David J. Brewer, U.S. Supreme Court, “This American nation from it first settlement at Jamestown to this hour is based on and permeated by the principles of the Bible.”   Thomas Henry Huxley, English biologist, “The Bible has been the Magna Charta of the poor and oppressed; down to modern times no state has a constitution in which the interests of the people are so largely taken into account; in which the duties so much more than the privileges of the rulers are insisted on…. Nowhere is the fundamental truth that the welfare of the state in the long run depends on the welfare of the citizens so strongly laid down.”   Isaac Newton, “I account the Scriptures of God the most sublime philosophy.”   Patrick Henry, “There is a Book worth all other books in the world!”   Now I understand, and so do you, that the sheer numbers or aggregate intelligence of a group believing something does not make it so! But these quotes are given not to declare the Bible to be the work of God (despite the fact that this is claim the quotes themselves make), but rather to help explain why we want to believe the Bible. It is apparent that the human mind was so designed by the Creator to believe in things for which it finds ample evidence for faith. The Bible itself provides that evidence. Therefore, we want to and do believe it to be the inspired Word of God!   These great men are simply acknowledging, through these quotes, what the Bible claims and proves for itself. Think about it– and then do something about it…. read you Bible and believe it to be the inspired Word of God given to provide salvation to mankind!

But Webster’s first lists its meanings as “suggestive or characteristic of a home; frequently encountered; of a sympathetic character” . May I suggest to you that our homes today need exactly those kinds of Dads?    Our homes need Dads who are “characteristic of a home” in that he needs to be a part of it. Study after study have shown that the absence of a father is the single greatest contributor to all kinds of problems in children specifically, and society more generally. Fathers who denigrate the very term by their absence (complete or consistent) cannot possibly fulfill their God-given duty to “bring them (their children) up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.” ( Ephesians 6:4b ) Sending a monthly check for child support does not cut it when it comes to fatherhood. Dad needs to be, as Mr. Webster suggested in his definition, “characteristic” of the home. He must be a constituent element of it. He needs to be, if you will, a consistent feature or characteristic of the home to be pleasing to God and of benefit to his family. How can any “head,” for that is exactly what he is to be according to Ephesians 5:23ff , really be such if he is never around?    I know, I know. “Well, I have to make a living!” We all do. And I, like you perhaps, have been guilty of being so worried about and involved with “making a living  for our families” that we forgot to “make a life  with our families.” Such takes a very simple thing: time at home and with our families. “Quality time” is just an excuse for spending too little of a precious commodity where it should be spent. The second of Mr. Webster’s definitions of “homely” was “frequently encountered” . OK Dad, are you “frequently encountered” at home with your family by them and visitors to it? Could you be called a “homely Dad” for that reason?    The final consideration of the definition of a “homely Dad” is that of being “of a sympathetic character” or disposition. Jesus said, “Permit the children to come to Me, and stop hindering them…” in Luke 18:16 . Surely the Lord was making a point to His disciples with this statement ( cf. v.15 ), but such wasn’t His only reason. He also was genuinely concerned with and “of sympathetic character” toward the children. He was sympathetic to their needs of His time and attention. When we don’t have time for a game of backyard catch, a tea party, a tee-ball game, a soft-ball game, or a piano recital, we aren’t being “homely Dads” because we aren’t being of a “sympathetic character” to the needs of our children. It’s hard to be sympathetic toward those who we don’t really know and with whom we’ve spent very little time. Ah, there’s that word again! It seems so much revolves around time. Children can certainly be over-dosed with sympathy to the point of enabling weakness and encouraging bad habits. But we Dads must also always remember that they are children, and have child-like fears, concerns, and desires. We can’t make them adults by ignoring that they are children– or all that comes with such. Spend time with your children so that you can be sympathetic to their needs. After all, Moms are great, but Dads are better at getting rid of the monsters under the bed!    “Homely” may indeed be less than flattering at best, and down-right derogatory otherwise, when applied to the female appearance. But when it comes to “Dads,” I hope it fits you to a tee! Dads, let’s strive to be “characteristic” of our homes, “frequently encountered” in our homes, and of “sympathetic character” and disposition toward those at our homes.

It has to do with trying to discover what the originator of the law, or whatever (usually) written document is under consideration, intended with the words utilized. Obviously, original intent has much to do with hermeneutics– the study of interpretations of written texts, and especially biblical hermeneutics . We all need to correctly interpret  God’s original intent!      When the Pharisees sought to “test” Jesus (in the early part of Matthew 19) by asking Him about “divorce,” He immediately took them back to the Garden of Eden- to the very origins of man. He answered their question, which was obviously meant only to entrap Him, by returning to God’s original intent , or purpose , for man in the area of marriage. Simply put, the plan was “one man, one woman, for life.” God hasn’t changed His mind. Yes, there were allowances made through the Law of Moses, “because of the hardness of your hearts” ( v.8 ), as Jesus admitted. However, He quickly added, “but from the beginning , it has not been this way.”     While we can discern much about the subject divorce by simply looking at God’s original intent , the benefits aren’t limited to that one subject. We can learn a lot about ourselves in several areas by examining God’s original intent for us.    For instance, when God created man, it didn’t take long for Him to conclude, “It is not good for man to be alone.” ( Gen.2:18 ) But why was, and is, this true? While most men look forward to and enjoy being “alone” with a rifle, shotgun, or fishing pole in their hands from time to time, or even sitting alone on a tractor all day occasionally, we also really like going home to find our “Eve” waiting for us! There is nothing like coming home from a day of solitary pursuits, to a warm embrace from your life’s love knowing that she feels the same about you! Now why is this? Quite simply, because such was God’s original intent for us in the way we were created. It is “not good for man to be alone” because that’s the way God made us. We were not meant to solitary creatures- some males of the animal kingdom were, but man was not. Bless our “Y” chromosomal hearts, man’s physical needs are very basic: food, the fulfillment of natural (sexual) desires God gave us, and sleep. But, we also have a fundamental  emotional need  of companionship. Note that God, when meeting this need, did not provide Adam with Steve, but Eve. Buddies and male friends are all well and good, but God’s original intent for man in the area of true companionship was a woman ! She meets needs and provides opportunities for man that no other man can- and I’m not talking about sex, I’m talking about companionship! God gave Adam someone with whom to share his hopes, dreams, joys, triumphs, fears, and tragedies in ways that no other man could accomplish. It is no different now- God’s original intent for man is still fulfilled in a female lifelong companion , otherwise, but elegantly called “wife” in all that the term implies. This was God’s original intent for man.    But there is another basic need of man that becomes apparent from an examination of original intent as discerned from Eden. Notice Genesis 2:15 , “Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it.” Have you ever wondered why Adam had to “cultivate and keep” God’s garden paradise? Jehovah had the omnipotence to speak light into existence before there was a sun to produce it. He also spoke the world into existence with nothing on which to hang it, and formed lifeless dirt into humanity. The point is: He did not need Adam to do His gardening for Him! So, why was Adam required to dress and keep the garden? Because it was part of God’s original intent for man, and as such, a part of man’s created nature, to have something to do. That is, man was created with a need to work .     God did not intend for Adam to just lie around enjoying the fruit of the Garden with nothing to do all day! Why not? Because God didn’t create man to be happy that way, that’s why. Oh sure, most men enjoy laying around watching football or just being “lazy” sometimes , but most of us wind up working harder on our “days off” than otherwise- even if we are just playing ! God created us to work, and we’re not happy for long when there’s nothing to do. Think about it: how often is some level of depression in men related to simply not having a “job” to do, or some project on which to work each day? God’s original intent for man in this regard was to work- for man to busy himself toward accomplishing something positive, especially to the support of his family. The New Testament also bears out this truth, “…let him labor, performing with his own hands what is good, that he may have something to share with him who has need.” ( Eph.4:28 ).    The bottom line is this: God at looked the man He created and knew that it was not good for him to: 1) be alone; or, 2) have nothing to do. Thus, it was God’s original intent for man both to have , and provide for , a wife. He needs her for companionship, but he also needs to be busy providing for her."],"title":["Original Intent"],"_resultNumber":65,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/original_intent","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":65},{"body":["Have you ever wondered what would happen if our spiritual mistakes had physical consequences? Since God’s laws and discipline is “for our good, that we may share His holiness” ( Hebrews 12:10b ), some sins certainly do have physical consequences, but not all of them do. But what if they all did? Not anything huge, just an uncomfortable “thump on the head” or “zap” electric shock to the fingertips? We’re tempted to think that could be a “good” deterrent- that it would help me not to sin if there was an immediate physical consequence to my poor choices and bad activities. Or, on the flipside, we might also think it would be easier to make good spiritual choices if there were an immediate physical benefit attached. However, if we think this through, there are “good” reasons that this is a “bad” idea- besides a head full of knots and charred fingertips….   It’s Pavlovian. Pavlov “trained” a dog to respond to conditions by ringing a bell just before food was dispensed. Eventually, each time the dog heard a bell ring he would begin to salivate. While this was a positively induced “conditioned response,” there can be negative ones as well. If you rub a puppy’s nose in his urine, spank his bottom, and put him outside every time he pees on the floor, he soon becomes “conditioned” to behave differently. (Please don’t tell me this is not the way to “house-train” a dog- it’s just an example.) If our spiritual choices are just a conditioned response, we’re no more than “spiritual dogs” (with apologies to canines), cf. Matthew 7:6 ; 2Peter 2:22 ; Revelation 22:15 .   It’s Quid Pro Quo. The phrase “quid pro quo” is derived from New Latin (first known use was 1582), and translates as “something for something.” Basically, it’s the same as the old “You scratch my back, and I’ll scratch yours” idea. But is this really how we want to operate with God? After the Babylonian captivity and return to Judea, some of the Israelites seemed to base their spiritual choices on this method. God addressed their thought processes through His prophet Malachi ( 3:14 ), “You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept His charge, and that we have walked in mourning before the Lord of hosts?’” When we think this way, it is pretty well certain that: 1) we’re not nearly as “faithful” as we think, cf. Malachi 3:1-13 ; and, 2) God has already blessed us so abundantly we can never “catch up” or “equal” His graciousness and magnanimity, Malachi 3:10 .   It’s Immature. Children want what they want now. At least part of what makes them “children” is the unwillingness to put off the perceived present benefits associated with “instant gratification” for future blessings. If the only reason we make “good” choices is for this kind of “instant gratification” reward, or to avoid the immediate negative consequences, we are spiritually immature, 1Corinthians 3:1-3 . On the other hand, if we are able to realize that even “good” choices may have immediate negative consequences now, but hold the key to future benefits of unfathomable proportions (heaven), and still make the right choices, then we are on the right track to spiritual maturity, cf. Hebrews 11:32-40 !  As parents, we want our children to learn to make “good” choices and do “the right thing,” not because there is some immediate benefit to doing so, or because there is an immediate negative consequence for failure. We want our children to learn to make “good” choices and do “the right thing” because these things are “good” and “right”- regardless of the immediate consequences. Guess what? We learned this from God. This is exactly why He wants us to be “good” and do “right” too! He wants us to obey Him not from any direct connection to immediate consequence, but because we love Him, John 14:15 ; because we want to please Him, Ephesians 5:10 ; and because we want to “be” good rather than just receiving the rewards of good “behavior,” Romans 12:2 . Now let’s see if we can “grow up” and serve God, rather than ourselves."],"title":["Physical and Spiritual Consequences"],"_resultNumber":66,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/physical_and_spiritual_consequences","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":66},{"body":["The evolutionary mantra seems to be that no matter how far-fetched a theory might be, if you proclaim it loud and long enough, people will believe it. They began attracting youngsters with fascinating tales of dinosaurs that lived millions of years ago, and the evolutionary time-table for the age of the earth has ballooned exponentially since. The question many fail to ask is: “Why does the age of the earth keep increasing in evolutionary models?”  The answer is simple. Timeis the only variable in the hypothesis. They start with matter , which despite their claims to the contrary, they must believe to be eternal (it had to come from somewhere, and could not create itself), and add energy (again from some source), to arrive at life . Then that single-celled life supposedly evolved into all living things now present. The only factor that placates the ridiculousness of this theory is time . They seem to think that if you just add enough time, anything is possible.  But the real problem I would like to address is that Creationists (those who believe in the Genesis account of creation) are being influenced by purported scientific data that says earth has been around for billions of years (13.7 currently). Though the Bible is not given to us for chronological purposes, there are some very credible and logical calculations made from it which indicate that the earth is 6015 years old (creation in 4004 B.C. {Julian calendar} + 2011 years since). [If you’re interested in these calculations see James Ussher’s work, Annals; p.17; and The Chronology of the Old Testament , by Dr. Floyd Nolan Jones, pp.26-29.] The stark contrast between the biblical and scientific numbers for the age of the planet has caused many Bible-believers to be conflicted. School and science says one thing, and the Word of God says something very different- which are they to believe? Don’t let Romans 3:4 escape you, “Rather, let God be found true, though every man be found a liar”!   So, how does the Christian deal with these conflicts? Some have retreated to the apostate position of compromising their belief in the biblical account with supposed scientific data. Specifically, the compromise is called “Theistic Evolution.” Perhaps oversimplified, “Theistic Evolution” states that: either God provided the “spark” which ignited the Big Bang, and then evolution proceeded from there; or that God created rudimentary life, and then allowed it to evolve over billions of years during the “Creation Period” of Genesis 1 & 2 . Essential to this last theory is the concept of “Time Gaps” between the stated “days of creation” in the Genesis account. These “Time Gaps” would allow for billions of years to occur between each of the days of creation. The problem with the first theory is that it completely dismisses the biblical account. And the problem with the second theory is that it fails to notice a couple of key pieces of evidence from the Bible. If you look carefully at Genesis 1 , you will notice that after each of the “days” of creation, it says “there was evening and morning,”  cf. vv.5,8,13,19,23,31 . At the conclusion of each of these creation events, the days are numbered one through six. Question: What sense does it make to specify “evening and morning,” and to number the “days” if billions of years elapsed between them? None. Furthermore, the whole “Time Gap” theory is completely dispelled in Exodus 20:11 , “For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh; therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.” Now what sense did it make for God to command a day of rest on the seventh day of the week for Jews to commemorate the six-day creation of the world if, in fact, it took billions of years to accomplish? Absolutely none!  Christian, don’t retreat into the apostate compromise of “Theistic Evolution”- believe God and His word. Also understand two things very clearly. First, the scientists who perform these dating tests take some very large “leaps of faith” in the assumptions they make to calculate the evolutionary model numbers for the age of the planet. And second, if God can speak light into existence three days before creating the sun ( cf. Gen.1:3-5 〉 14-19 ), and if He can create from dust a mature man (and He did both), then He can also create a mature earth! God said in 1Corinthians 1:19 , “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the cleverness of the clever I will set aside.”"],"title":["The Compromise of Theistic Evolution"],"_resultNumber":67,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/the_compromise_of_theistic_evolution","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":67},{"body":["What is commonly called “Tunnel Vision” is more specifically “Kalnienk Vision.” The condition refers to a restriction of one’s field of vision, but with the retention of central vision; i.e. as if looking through a tunnel . Though it can have many different causes, the most common culprit is the consistent restriction of the field of vision, which causes the eyes to be “trained” to only focus on the specific area in which one is looking. For instance, if you looked through a periscope for long periods of time, or wore a welding helmet, diving mask, or something else which only allowed you to see the area or objects immediately in front of you, tunnel vision could easily occur. The result would be that you would only be able to “see” those things at which you specifically looked or directed your attention. It is a dangerous condition physically , but can be spiritually devastating.  As is the case with the physical impairment, spiritual Tunnel Vision is most often self-inflicted. We repetitively and consistently focus our attention on a specific passage, interpretation, or doctrine until we lose the ability to see anything else. This is especially dangerous because it becomes self-perpetuating. A certain passage that we think contains a cherished belief is so much the focus of our attention that we get to the point that we will not even consider other passages which clearly contradict our interpretation of the one upon which we’ve become affixed. “Spiritual Tunnel Vision” has occurred! Let’s consider some examples.    John 3:16  is a beautiful and powerful passage that highlights both God’s tremendous love for man, as well as man’s obligation to believe in order to attain eternal life. But for some, this passage has come to be a proof-text for salvation by “faith only.” Has intense focus on this verse clouded our ability to see its context? Can we no longer see that in v.5 Jesus also required one to be baptized ( “born of water and the Spirit” )? Can we no longer see that v.36 enjoined obedience to our belief in order to attain eternal life? Do we no longer see the example immediately preceding v.16 in the text? It references the O.T. story of fiery serpents being sent by God among the Israelites as punishment for their complaining in the wilderness ( see Numbers 21:4-9 ). The people who were bitten by the serpents had to look upon the replica that God commanded Moses to erect on a standard in the midst of the camp or die. They couldn’t just “believe” and “accept” that God would heal them, they had to meet His requirement of obedience by going to and looking upon the serpent. Additionally, have we become so intently focused upon John 3:16 that we no longer can see James 2:24 , “You see that a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone.” This passage doesn’t teach that one is saved by “works alone” any more than John 3:16 teaches that one is saved by “faith alone.” But we cannot become so specifically focused on either one that the other can no longer be seen. Both passages are inspired by the Holy Spirit, and neither is more important than the other!    Romans 8:38-39  is likewise a tremendously comforting passage which teaches the love and protection God manifests toward His children. But does it say that “once we are saved, we are always saved”? The passage makes it very clear that nothing can separate the saved from the love God has for them. But does that mean they will necessarily inherit the blessings of eternal salvation unconditionally? Can a loving parent not disown and disinherit a rebellious child? Of course they can! But will our loving Father do that to His unloving and disobedient children? Don’t fall prey to spiritual tunnel vision! Note these passages: “keep yourselves in the love of God” ( Jude 21 ); “be on your guard lest, being carried away by unprincipled men, you fall from your own steadfastness” ( 2Peter 3:17 ); “Take care, brethren, lest there be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart, in falling away from the living God” ( Hebrews 3:12 ). Have we become so focused on a passage that we think teaches a comforting doctrine that we can no longer see that every book of the N.T. (except one, Philemon) contains warnings specifically designed to prevent the very thing that supposedly cannot happen- losing salvation once it has been gained?  Please, read your New Testament- all of it; and don’t become so focused on what you may want it to say that you cannot see what it does say. I do not have all the answers, nor do I claim to have them- but, I do know that we cannot give any one passage an interpretation that clearly contradicts another. We have to take it all, and keep it all together to “see clearly” what God would have us to believe and obey."],"title":["Spiritual “Tunnel Vision”"],"_resultNumber":68,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/spiritual_tunnel_vision","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":68},{"body":["No doubt there have been more than a few recent references to the passage in James 5:18ff which repeats the O.T. story of Elijah praying for rain. And I’m sure several of these references to the story also emphasized that “Elijah was a man with a nature like ours” from v.17 in an effort to make the point that we too can and should beseech the Father for rain. There’s nothing wrong with any of these things- righteous men (see v.16 ) should be asking God for rain! But somehow, the later part of v.17 doesn’t get as much attention. It says, “and he (Elijah) prayed earnestly that it might not rain , and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.” Incidentally, the word translated as “earth” can also be rendered as “land” or “country”- either of which I suspect is closer to the intended meaning of the verse. Now back to the point, I know there have been many East Texans asking God for rain lately, including me, but I wonder if any have been praying that it might not rain like Elijah did at first?  Though the account in James 5 does not specify, do you know why Elijah first prayed that it would not rain? The O.T. book of 1Kings 17 records the ascension of Ahab to the throne of Israel. In v.30 it says that he “did evil in the sight of the Lord more than all who were before him.” The text of v.33 adds, “Thus Ahab did more to provoke the Lord, the God of Israel, than all the kings of Israel who were before him.” It seems that the nation of Israel either tolerated or followed King Ahab’s idolatry to such an extent that Elijah prayed for a drought to punish them, and to bring them back to an understanding of their complete dependence upon Jehovah. They evidently needed to be reminded of what Paul told the folks in Lystra- that God “did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.” ( Acts 14:17 ) It is so very easy to take things like rain and fruitful seasons for granted- until you don’t have them!  Now, all of that was to get to a couple of points for your consideration. First, I don’t know whether God has deliberately withheld rain from us to punish us for idolatry or not. But it would sure be a good time to return to the true worship of Jehovah if we haven’t been doing so! By percentage, there are probably more of us worshipping the idol of “self” instead of Him on any given Sunday- not to mention the rest of the week. We should instead “seek God, if perhaps they (we) might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us.” ( Acts 1:27 ) Secondly, I don’t know whether God is trying to teach us that we’ve gotten too big for our britches, and need to return to an understanding of our complete dependence upon Him or not. But I do know that it would be a really good time to acknowledge that it is “in Him that we live and move and exist” ( Acts 17:28 ). If you don’t believe that, then you make it rain. Furthermore, I don’t know whether some present-day Elijah (remember, he was a man of God) has prayed that it might not rain here or not. But I do know that if drought is what it takes to turn us back to God, the true worship of Him, and the acknowledgement of our utter dependence upon Him, we had better be thankful and start heeding the message! After all, even a summer’s worth of temperatures over 100 is still a lot better than an eternity in hell.  Just to be sure to avoid any misunderstanding, I do not know why we’ve been so long without rain. But when a person, or any group of them, is in sin, it’s always “the right time” to repent, “Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all everywhere should repent, because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man who He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead.”  Acts 17:30 Please think about it."],"title":["Elijah, Rain, and Dependency"],"_resultNumber":69,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/elijah_rain_and_dependency","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":69},{"body":["I haven’t squirrel hunted in years- many years. But I did kill one the other day. It was really more his fault than mine (if I do say so myself!). I was driving east on Myrtle Street. I saw him clearly- he was a big rascal, and even had what appeared to be a huge pecan in his mouth. He darted out in front of my car, but had plenty of time to make it on across the street. But when he saw the car, he froze momentarily....  Even after stopping, he still had plenty of time to reach the safety of the roadside. It was the indecision that cost him. Right before he went under the car, he must have changed directions a half a dozen times! Any decision he had made and stuck with would have saved his life. But the indecision and vacillation cost him much more than just his prize pecan!  Sometimes we humans don’t appear much smarter than that squirrel- and for the same reasons. Hesitation, indecision, and vacillation can cost us too. In Genesis 19 , Abraham’s nephew Lot, when warned by the angels to take his family and flee from the coming destruction of the wicked city Sodom, was only spared by the “compassion of the Lord” . The text says of Lot, “But he hesitated.” ( v.6 ) His hesitation almost cost him everything. He had the clear command from God regarding what he should do, but apparently lacked the resolve to be decisively obedient .   1Kings 18:21 records an occasion when God’s prophet, Elijah, rebuked Israel for their attempts to serve both God and the Canaanite idol, Baal. He said, “How long will you hesitate between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.” The sad epitaph ensues, “But the people did not answer him a word.” They were so indecisive and ‘wishy-washy’ that they couldn’t, or wouldn’t, even answer the charge.  In addition to these Old Testament examples, the New Testament also has its condemnations of such inabilities. The church at Laodicea was reproached: “I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot; I would that you were cold or hot. So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth.” ( Revelation 3:15-16 ) I don’t really mean to be overly graphic, but to put it in plain language, the Lord said that those who can’t seem to make up their minds to be fully committed to Him and His cause “aren’t worth spit,” and would be thus expelled from His Body. The epistle of James refers to this hesitant indecision and vacillation as being “double-minded” ( 1:8; 4:8 ), and similarly condemns it.  The squirrel’s inability to see the “right” path, make a clear decision to take it, and then faithfully follow through, cost him his life. The same inabilities in humans can cost much more- it can cost us our souls. After the apostle Paul had discussed righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come with the wicked Roman Governor, Felix became frightened by these truths, but replied, “Go away for the present, and when I find time, I will summon you.” ( Acts 24:25 ). There is no record in the Bible or history that Felix ever obeyed the truth Paul had presented him. Apparently, he was pretty “squirrely”!

Even when the petition is made in the full assurance of faith that God has the ability to grant the request, it often just doesn’t come to fruition for us. In light of the promises made by God in such passages such as Matthew 7:7-11 , why is this? While there may be several answers (such as, I’m asking God to do something for me that I ought to be doing myself, or at least doing my part to achieve, or asking for something that is not according to His will { i.e. what is ultimately right or best}), the short one is “The reason matters.”  “The reason matters” relates not only to the request itself, but also why you/we desire it. For example, do you pray for patience constantly without really sensing any improvement in that area of your life? If so, then perhaps you should back up and ask yourself a searching question: “Why do I want God to give me patience?” If the answer is “So  my  life will be easier” or “less stressful,” or some other selfishly motivated reason, such could be well be the reason that particular request hasn’t been granted. If, on the other hand, the answer was, “So I can be a better servant of God, and more beneficial to others in becoming the same,” do you suppose that such a motivation would garner a different response from the Father?  Note an example of exactly the point I’m trying to make from 1Kings 3 . Solomon was given the opportunity to ask for anything he wanted of God. His decision is manifested in the prayer of vv.6-9 , the crux of which is found in v.9a , “So give Thy servant an understanding heart to judge Thy people to discern between good and evil.” Solomon didn’t ask for wisdom so he could be “the wisest man on the planet”- that would have been selfish. Instead, he: acknowledged the past loving-kindness God had shown his father, David, v.6 ; acknowledged his unworthiness to be king due his youth and inexperience, v.7 ; acknowledged the enormity of the task before him to rule the great people of God, v.8 ; and then asked for the ability to perform God’s will in the best manner possible to carry out the task God had laid before him. In other words, he asked for the ability to serve God and God’s people in a way that would glorify the Father, rather than himself! Now, is that a different premise from which most of your unanswered prayers are formed?  In James 4:1-4 , the Lord’s brother first identifies wrong pleasure sources as being the cause of “quarrels and conflicts among you,”  v.1 . I really don’t think James is addressing, in this verse, conflicts   between     people  as much as conflicts   within     the individual ; which seems to be borne out by the internal sinful motivations of “lust…envy” which produce the outward sins of “murder…fight(ing)…quarrel(ling)” mentioned in v.3 (see also Romans 7:14-23 , where Paul likewise addresses this conflict within ). Additionally, the Greek preposition en, which most all of the major translations render here as “ among you” in v.1 , can just as accurately be translated as “ in you,”- which strengthens the notion of internal rather than external conflict. But, let’s not lose the point: wrong pleasure sources existed, which, in turn, prevented their petitions from being granted by God. Note v.3 specifically on this, “You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives , so that you may spend it on your pleasures”- and their pleasures were, as previously noted, wrongly sourced!  So, if your prayerful requests aren’t being granted, it could be that you are asking: 1) for wrong things , or at least asking for things God knows you don’t need, and/or that aren’t best; or, 2) with wrong motives . If the objects of your requests are selfish, or even selfishly motivated, it seems pretty clear that those requests are going to be denied by the Father. But, if your requests are for the purpose of making you a better servant, and therefore enable you to bring glory to God rather than yourself, well, that’s a completely different matter! Before you pull out “your list” of prayer requests the next time, remember the words of Solomon and James, and the humble and selfless motivations they exemplify."],"title":["The Reasons Matter"],"_resultNumber":71,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/the_reasons_matter","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":71},{"body":["When it comes to watching television, I watch mostly sports, old movies, and some science or nature programing- but sports probably gets the lion’s share of my TV-viewing time. This is probably because I enjoyed playing sports as a youngster. The school I attended growing up was too small (and poor!) for football, but I played just about everything else that was offered. Thus, basketball and baseball were mainstays. Nonetheless, I enjoy watching baseball, basketball, and football (especially college).  There is, however, one thing that really frustrates me (besides commercials, which I avoid like the plague!): why do athletes at seemingly every level now feel the need to  taunt  the opposition? Back when sports were supposed to teach something besides “winning” and “making more money,” sportsmanship, teamwork, integrity, respect, and fair-play were lessons that were always emphasized in and through the games and practices. And so, the image of a safety standing over a downed receiver after a “big hit,” or power forward mouthing off and gesturing to one on whom he has just “dunked,” or a tailback or wide-out doing some sort of “touchdown dance celebration,” is just plain repulsive. These things are all about self-aggrandizement, and undermine the very definition of the word “sportsmanship.” At least some seem to agree, since this kind of behavior occasionally draws a penalty or technical foul.  Glorying in the defeat of an enemy, which is really what “taunting” is all about, is not just repulsive to me, it is distasteful to God. Job understood this. Consider his words recorded in Job 31:29-30 , “Have I rejoiced at the extinction of my enemy, or exulted when evil befell him? No, I have not allowed my mouth to sin… ” Job seems to comprehend that God does not delight in the demise of the ungodly ( cf. Ezekiel 18:23,32 ), and that neither should we rejoice in the humbling, or catastrophic demise of our enemies. Jonah, however, did not get this point.  God had sent Jonah to preach to Nineveh, the great city of the Assyrians. The Assyrians were fierce and brutal people whom Jonah considered to be an, if not the, enemy. And yet, God knew the Assyrians also had souls which needed saving, cf. John 4:10-11 . So, Jonah was sent to preach to them- but he didn’t want to, and tried to flee to avoid it. Even after he was “convinced” (by a God-sent storm and great fish) to preach to the Ninevites, and they responded in repentance and obedience, Jonah still wasn’t happy. In fact, he was just plain mad about it, cf. Jonah 4:1ff . He even went outside of the city, built himself a shelter, and sat down under it to wait “until he could see what would happen in the city,”  4:5b . He was still hoping God would destroy them after all, and then he could “taunt” (rejoice over the demise of) his perceived enemies!  There are some athletes, certainly in the minority, who congratulate their opponent on a good tackle, or a nice shot, or a great play, and then line up and go again. They seem to understand that it is, after all, only a game, and that there are “bigger” issues at stake than personal glory or success. What refreshing sportsmanship, and I applaud them for their attitude and conduct! But I can’t help but wonder, when the “wrong” lessons are instead being learned and exhibited in sports, if they are influencing our cultural mindset with regard to how we treat perceived enemies and opponents? After all, sports are just sports (or at least are supposed to be), but life is life. If we can’t figure out how to properly treat one another when we “play,” how will we possibly do so in real-world, real-life situations? Are we really that different from old Jonah?  Jesus crystalized this required godly attitude in Matthew 5:44 , “love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.” If we have a real enemy (besides Satan, cf. Ephesians 6:11-12 ), or even a perceived one, wouldn’t Jesus’ words require us to at least treat them with respect, and genuinely desire “good” for them? And if we do this, are they really still an “enemy”- at least from our perspective? If we can’t love and treat well those who don’t love and treat us well, we can’t be children of God, Matthew 5:45-48 . Obviously, these things are much more important than “good sportsmanship” in an athletic contest, but, if you can’t enjoy the game without abusing and debasing your opponent, please take up Solitaire!"],"title":["“Taunting”"],"_resultNumber":72,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/taunting","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":72},{"body":["Run and hide from an omnipresent God.” Just ask Jonah ( Jonah 1-4 ). God told Jonah to go and urge the great city of Nineveh to repent to avoid complete destruction for their exceeding wickedness. But Jonah viewed the Assyrians, of which Nineveh was the capital city, as Israel’s enemy. So, he attempted to “run and hide” from God’s requirements. Obviously, that didn’t work for a very simple reason: God is everywhere, Psalms 139:7-12 . We simply cannot “run and hide” from the God who is everywhere, or from His requirements of us, Luke 11:30 .   Fight an omnipotent God.” Just ask Pharaoh ( Exodus 7-12 ). The Egyptian king had enslaved and greatly mistreated God’s people. God sent His deliverer, Moses, to Pharaoh with a straightforward command, “Let My people go.” But Pharaoh refused to comply, and tried to fight against the God of heaven. Ten plagues later, when even Pharaoh’s own firstborn son was dead, he relented. But even after Israel left Egypt, Pharaoh changed his mind again, and pursued them. That didn’t work too well either, as God destroyed the Egyptian army in the Red Sea, Exodus 14 . We simply cannot “fight” the all-powerful God.   Outsmart an omniscient God.” Just ask the Christians in Rome. God, through Paul’s inspired letter to them, explained that the ungodly and unrighteous world sought to “suppress the truth,”  Romans 1:18 . To do so, they had to ignore the obvious- the eternal power and the divine nature of God that was clearly evident within the creation, and themselves, vv.19-20 . So, though wise in their own eyes, they became foolish enough to reject the very existence of God, vv.21-22 . This led to rampant idolatry, v.23 , all sorts of depravity, vv.24-31 , and the ultimate rejection of God’s word, v.32 . However, since everyone will be judged by the Word, John 12:48 , they simply could not “outsmart” the all-knowing God- nor can we.   Outlast an eternal God.” In conflicts between men, it is not always the smartest or the strongest that wins- sometimes the ultimate winner is simply the one who outlasts his opponent. Will this tactic work with God? Hardly. Physical man is a mortal and finite being. From his very beginning, everything about him is marked and governed by time. Psalm 90:10 says that our days will be about 70 or 80 years. But God, who is immortal and infinite, is neither marked nor governed by time, vv.1-2 . No, we simply cannot hope to overcome by “outlasting” the eternal God.   “But neither can we…    Exhaust His ability to love.” We typically “love” for selfish reasons- because there is some perceived value in this person to us. But God’s love establishes a value rather than requiring one. Note Romans 5:8 to illustrate, “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were sinners , Christ died for us.” The point is that while we were sinners (or “enemies,”  v.10 ), and therefore contained no inherent value to God, His love  established  sufficient value in us for Him to be willing to sacrifice His Son to save us. Such love is simply inexhaustible. We can, however, miss the benefits of that love by failing to appropriate its sacrifice. We do so by refusing to obey the gospel. But nonetheless, the very essence of God is love, 1John 4:8-10 . Therefore, it cannot be exhausted, for then the eternal God would cease to exist.   Exceed His power to save.” No matter how far we have strayed into sin and depravity- perhaps because of the above mentioned futile attempts to oppose and reject God, we cannot exceed His power to save, Romans 5:20 . God has invested His power to save in the gospel, 1:16 . If we will: in faith turn to Christ, 10:10 ; confess Him as Lord of our lives (which necessarily includes repentance), 10:9 ; and be buried with Him in baptism, 6:3-4 ; then any and all sins, no matter how heinous or depraved, can and will be forgiven, 6:5-7 . Just ask Saul of Tarsus, cf. 1Timothy 1:13-14 .  It makes no sense whatsoever to oppose and reject an omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient, and eternal God.

So, what was the source of the light created on day one until the sun was created on day four? The “source” was surely the power of God manifested through His  Word   ,  cf. John 1:1ff ! What magnificent power was manifested through the Word of God- sufficient to speak into existence ample light to illumine the world!  The power of God’s word to transform a “formless and void” sphere into an inhabitable planet that provides creation’s every essential, and even esthetic, need is not the only example of its abilities to create or convert. When the prophet Jonah was sent to great and exceedingly wicked city of Nineveh, his message from God was simply and direct, “Yet forty days and Nineveh will be overthrown,”  Jonah 3:4 . While I’m fairly certain this wasn’t the sum total of God’s word to the Ninevites that Jonah proclaimed, the power of whatever was said is obvious, “Then the people of Nineveh believed in God; and they called a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least of them…”  cf. vv.5-9 . The word of God transformed these exceedingly violent and wicked Assyrians into penitent believers- so much so that “God saw their deeds, that they turned from their wicked way, then God relented concerning the calamity which He had declared He would bring upon them. And He did not do it,”  v.10 !  Other examples of the transforming power of God’s word- such as Israel being turned from idolatry during the reign of the boy-king Josiah, or the great persecutor of the church, Saul of Tarsus, being converted into an ardent proclaimer of the gospel, the apostle Paul, could be given. But hopefully, the point has been sufficiently made: God’s word is extremely powerful, and has great transforming abilities!   I’m not suggesting that Jacksonville is a “great and exceedingly wicked city” like Nineveh- but it does need the transforming power of the gospel. Everyone everywhere needs it! The apostle Paul declared it to be “the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes” in Romans 1:16 . Nothing has changed in that regard. If one is going to be saved, it will be by obedience to the gospel, 1Peter 1:22 . And, if people are to be saved by God’s power through the gospel, it necessarily follows that it must be preached- simply, plainly, and fully. Consider Romans 10 on this point, “How then shall they call upon Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? …So then faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ,”  vv.14,17 .  To these ends, Brother Kris Emerson (of Beaumont, TX) will be preaching the gospel in love, power, and enthusiasm at the Southside Church of Christ, Sunday, February 10 th  , through Wednesday, February 13 th  . Kris will speak “words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household” ( Acts 11:14 ) in their full and powerful saving grace with all dignity and love. Won’t you come and hear the gospel? It is God’s power to save by the blood of Jesus Christ!

Proverbs 10:15 “The rich man’s wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty.”    Once, while traveling back to Jacksonville, I listened on the radio to a Dr. of Economics by the name of Walter Williams- you may have heard of him or read some of his editorials sometimes printed in the Tyler paper. He is a very level-headed-kind of fellow, at least as far as I can tell. This particular day, he gave several keys to avoiding poverty, which piqued my interest. His “keys” were gleaned from statistical studies that showed common denominators of “poor” people. That is, these studies highlighted common characteristics of the poor. From these, Dr. Williams simply turned negative characteristics around to form positive affirmations of what folks can do to avoid poverty. As best as I can remember, the keys were:   finish High School,  get a job,  get married before having children, and  stay married.   That was it! From the statistics, the opposites of these were the most common attributes of poor people. That is, most poor people do not finish High School, do not get jobs, have children without the blessing of marriage, and typically divorce their mates if and when they do get married. Dr. Williams thus concluded that avoiding these situations and circumstances would largely insure the avoidance of poverty in life. While there are surely other “keys,” I must agree that these are an awfully good start. And “Yes,” there are exceptions. But it cannot be avoided, these are the common denominators (or characteristics) gleaned from statistical study. However, I began thinking about a couple of things relative to all of this…  First, most of these are things Christians do because they’re commanded and right, not to get rich or avoid poverty. People who are trying to live godly do their best to do what God says is right. And God’s commands are always for man’s good. Therefore, it’s easy to see how keeping them is in our best interest now in this life, and then in the next.  Second, turn all of this around and think of them in spiritual terms. How do we avoid spiritual poverty? While again there are certainly other factors involved, think about the importance of these same keys relative to their importance in avoiding being spiritually devoid of substance.  The importance of a good, basic education. The prophet Hosea lamented in his day that God’s people were being destroyed for “lack of knowledge” (Hos.4:6). You don’t need some sort of spiritual Ph.D. to be pleasing to God. But obviously, you do have to know what is “pleasing to the Lord” (Eph.6:10) in order to avoid spiritual poverty! It is not the “Truth” which sets us free from sin and spiritual poverty. If you look closely at John 8:32, it is the “Truth” which is known that liberates.  Be gainfully employed in the Lord’s service. It has often been said, “Idle hands are the Devil’s workshop.” While that’s not a direct biblical quote, at least to my knowledge, there are many passages which emphasize the importance of bearing “much fruit” in our service to Him, John 15:8; and being one who is “always abounding in the work of the Lord” (1Cor.15:58). Surely such a one as this cannot be considered, let alone be, spiritually poor! Those actively involved in the Lord’s work, rarely stray from richness of His favor.  Getting ‘married’ to Christ and staying that way. At one time in this country, the most sacred and solemn vows made by most folks were those given in matrimony. Then, even the “unchurched” meant and kept the words they promised to their mates “before God and man” in their wedding ceremonies. Obviously, such is rarely taken as seriously now, if spoken at all. But, perhaps one of the reasons behind this sad reality is a similar lack of commitment to our Him who should be our Spiritual Husband. If we would be “joined” to Jesus as our husband, we must indeed be willing to “forsake all others and cling only to Him.” Luke 14:26 makes this abundantly clear when He said, “Now if anyone comes to Me, and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, even his own life, he cannot be My disciple.” This kind and level of commitment will not only get us married to Jesus Christ, it will keep us married to Him “until death”! Certainly in such a spiritual relationship, married to the “King of kings and Lord of lords,” we could never be spiritually in need! “The Lord is My Shepherd, I shall not want” is still true provided we will go where He goes and lodge wherever He lodges with regard to our spiritual Husband, Jesus the Christ.  Yes, there are other important things we can and must do to insure ourselves against spiritual poverty. But, it sure is hard to argue against the importance of these! And oh by the way, and just to be sure you don’t misunderstand, know that most of the truly spiritually rich people in the Bible were physically poor. “But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you.” Matt.6:33"],"title":["Poverty: The Destruction of the Poor"],"_resultNumber":75,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/poverty_the_destruction_of_the_poor","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":75},{"body":["Have you ever split firewood the “old fashioned” way? You know, the way where the “splitter” has a handle that is  not  attached to a hydraulic cylinder, but an ax or maul head? Although I have sometimes used the gasoline/hydraulic kind, mostly I still use the other kind of handles to split our firewood. When the boys were younger, they would see me bursting open the blocks and want to give it try. Invariably, they would swing as hard as they could, and also just as invariably, they would miss the spot they needed to hit to get the wood to split. Such is not uncommon- I did the same thing when I was just learning. But the trick is not how hard you hit it, but hitting it with consistency- meaning hitting the same place multiple times. Otherwise, you wind up making more kindling splinters than firewood! It occurs to me that many of us approach Christianity and our service to God the same way...  We want to “hit it as hard as we can” once or twice a year, and expect great results. That’s why we make sure to “go to church” on Christmas and Easter, and are generally much better people during December than we are in July!  This isn’t a new phenomenon by any means. Peter and the other eleven disciples proudly proclaimed, “… ‘Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You.’ All the disciples said the same thing too.” ( Matthew 26:35 ) In their minds, they were ready to make the great and grand sacrifice of their very lives for Christ. And yet, in the Garden of Gethsemane, on the same night (of Jesus’ betrayal), when He asked them to “keep watch with Me,” He returned to find them sleeping not once, not twice, but three times. ( Matthew 26:36-45 ) At the most pivotal time of His life, they slept. They thought they were ready to make the “big” sacrifice and die for Him, but in reality couldn’t even stay awake and lend whatever support they could offer for a few hours.  Naaman also had this “big thing” mentality with regard to being cleansed from his leprosy. He was a “big” man- captain of the Syrian army, and as such expected Elisha (God’s prophet) to make some appropriately grand gesture to heal him. 2Kings 5:11 records his words, “I thought, ‘He will surely come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place, and cure the leper.” Probably because he knew Naaman’s heart and expectations, Elisha didn’t even come out of his house. Instead, he sent a messenger to Naaman telling him to go and dip himself seven times in the Jordan River to be cleansed. Naaman was furious, at least until his servants questioned him, “…had the prophet told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more then, when he says, ‘Wash, and be clean?’” ( 2Kings 5:13 ) That’s insightful logic, and a great question! And it worked- Naaman went to the Jordan, dipped himself seven times as commanded, and came up cleansed. It wasn’t a “big” or “grand” gesture that God required of him, just simple obedience.  The same is true for us. While being faithful to God might require the sacrifice of our lives through persecution- and we should certainly be willing to die for Him ( Matthew 16:25 ), given when and where we live, this is thankfully unlikely. But faithfulness does require the simple, consistent, day-to-day obedience to God’s words. In this way we become a “living and holy sacrifice” ( cf. Heb.12:1 ) by   livin g  for Him daily , rather than dying for Him once. This isn’t the “big” and “grand” gesture Peter or Naaman had in mind- it is the simple, consistent life of obedience to God. What about you? Are you looking and waiting for the one “big” hit, or are you consistently and patiently “hitting the mark” of obedience every day?

Not only do I not think that fast, I’m not sure I want my car to either! In fact, I’d prefer to do most of the thinking for both of us. Then on the other hand, if that old truck of mine had been one of these new “thinking” types, we might not have rolled over and wrecked recently! But know this: when performing complicated tasks like driving or living, there are a whole bunch of decisions that are going to have to be made by someone …or something (God help us!). Such brings a couple of points to mind relative to “thinking” and “decisions”: (1) good decisions typically require considerable thought at first, then become easier as we get used to making them; and (2) eventually, many good decisions come to require no thought at all, and hence cease to really even be decisions- we just do the right thing without even thinking about it. Let’s consider both of these points a little more.  The reason good decisions take more thought when we first attempt to start making them is simple: we lack the experience of having made them before, or hundreds of times before. So initially, we have to pray for guidance (always a good idea), determine what our options are, weigh and consider those options in light of the Scriptures, and we might also “consider the outcome” of the decisions others have made in similar circumstances ( Hebrews 13:7 ) before coming to a decision. Having done all of this and come to a decision, hopefully we can then act accordingly. But as we repeat this process multiple times, fewer steps are required to come to the correct answers because we’re learning from our own experience as we go. Unfortunately, as many have said, “The experience required to make good decisions sometimes comes from making bad decisions.” This is true, but the point is that we learn from the process. Some just keep repeating the same mistakes over and over. Hebrews 5:12 speaks of this problem, “For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for some one to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God…” If we keep making the same bad decisions over and over, there is something wrong with our process!  The other major point relative to making good decisions is that not only should making them become easier with practice, many of them will cease to be decisions at all. We will just do the right thing(s) instinctively without even having to think about it. After all, before we started trying to make good and right decisions according to God’s word, did we have to “think about” and “decide” to do wrong? Not likely. We had probably become so accustomed to living that way that it became instinctive to us- we just did evil “without giving it a second thought.” Such is exactly what Ephesians 2: 3 is addressing, “Among them we too all lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.” Therefore, just as bad decisions can become so habitual as to not even require thought, good decisions can also. “But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil.” ( Hebrews 5:14 )  But the problem is that many of us still have to “think” about things that ought to be automatic or instinctive by now. For example, be honest with yourself and answer this question: “Is a decision required in your house each Sunday as to whether or not you (and your family) are going to worship the Lord and encourage your brethren?” If this doesn’t require a decision, I know why. You either: (1) never really think about doing so ; or (2) you never really think about  not doing so! Again, be honest- why are you still having to think about and decide this? If you’re not sick (too tired or hung-over from the previous day’s or night’s activities doesn’t count) or prevented (meaning that you have no choice or decision in the matter), shouldn’t it be instinctive for a child of God to assemble with their brethren to worship Him and encourage one another? If we still have to “think” about and “decide” this one, we might better backup and review how we’re making our decisions. If other “things” take precedence over the “the Lord’s day” in our decision-making, are we really “seeking first the kingdom of God”  Matthew 6:33 ?"],"title":["“Decisions, Decisions!”"],"_resultNumber":77,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/decisions_decisions","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":77},{"body":["The “forty years of evolution” in the title is not from the time it has been taught, but from the time of my exposure to it. In that time-frame, the theory has “evolved” (excuse the pun) much, but the basic problem associated with it has changed little.   Hebrews 3:4 records, “For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.” In a mere fifteen words, these divinely-inspired words completely undo forty year’s worth of evolutionary teaching. Here’s how.  No right-thinking person looks at a house and proposes an evolutionary cause for its obvious existence. No one thinks that an explosion of materials of unknown origin created the immaculate design, orderly arrangement, and intricate construction of a house. And yet, this is precisely what evolutionary theory tries to convince us happened to create the design, order, and construction of our world and universe!  Our passage uses what is commonly known as “Cause and Effect.” Simply stated, “Cause and Effect” says that for every known effect , an adequate  cause must exist to have produced it. Understand the importance of the word “adequate” in this principle law. In the example of the house, the house is the effect. Its obvious existence cannot be adequately explained by an explosion of materials from an unknown source, ignited by a spark of energy from an unknown cause, random chance, or benign environmental forces acting upon those materials. No one makes such outrageous assumptions when they see the “effect” of a house, but somehow many make the very same assumptions, and profusely peddle them, when it comes to the origin of life itself, our world, and the universe!  But houses come into being when an intelligently creative being imagines and designs them, an expressive draftsman reveals the plans for them, and a skilled master builder constructs them. Thus it also is with life, the world, and universe: God the Father designed them ( Acts 17:28; 1Corinthians 8:6 ), God the Spirit revealed the plans for them ( 1Corinthians 2:10-13 ), and God the Son built them ( Hebrews 1:2b; Colossians 1:15-16 ).  The atheist sees the “house” (effect) of life and the universe and postulates a theory to be the “builder” (cause) of it- evolution is result. The believer sees the same “house” and understands an entirely different “builder”- God, the first and only uncaused Cause. Both start with something. The evolutionist starts with lifeless matter for which he does not have an origin, and has it exploding into life and orderly design. The creationist starts with the eternal mind, power, and person of God as the source of life, order, and design. Think about a “house” (effect), and tell me which one is the “builder” (cause) which is adequate to have produced it.  Think also of the collateral results associated with this decision. Since evolution necessarily eliminates God from our existence, the resulting atheism affects all aspects of our lives. If God does not exist, then man is not created “in God’s image” ( Genesis 1:26 ), but is only a higher animal with no real purpose other than the instinct to survive as he pleases as long as possible. If God does not exist, then marriage is not an institution of divine origin and regulation created and given for human happiness ( Genesis 2:18-24 ), but a meaningless arrangement to be used and abused as we please. If God does not exist, then a yet unborn child is not a “gift of the Lord” ( Psalm 127:3 ), but a “non-viable tissue mass” which we are free to kill at our convenience. If God does not exist, then life here and now is not a necessary preparation for eternity ( 1Corinthians 15:35-58 ), but a miserably hopeless pursuit of things which cannot last.  Now, in which “house” do you want to live: the one “built” by God, or the one “built” by evolution? One gives us purpose in life, the greatest happiness this side of heaven in holy matrimony, the unspeakable joy of completely selfless love, and eternal existence in heaven. The other makes us animals with no purpose in life, gives us misery and pain in our closest possible associations, turns us into murderers of the innocent, and condemns us to a hopeless existence terminated only by death.

More importantly, they reflect very badly on society as a whole. The sexual abuse of anyone, but especially children, is a deplorable thing; so is the taking of an innocent, unborn life; so is taking another’s life and property to support a drug habit; so is “I was too drunk to know/remember what I was doing;” so is…you get the point. How did we, as a society, get here?   Psalm 14:1 begins, “The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” Certainly there are plenty today who agree, and thus classify themselves as did the psalmist. But the verse continues with, “They are corrupt, they have committed abominable deeds…” When the Gentiles depicted in Romans 1  “suppress(ed) the truth in unrighteousness” ( v.18 ), and “even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God” ( v.21 ), they indeed became “fools” ( v.22 ), just like David said hundreds of years before. Because of this God “gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity ….gave them over to degrading passions ….gave them over to a depraved mind …” ( vv.24,26,28 ). Make no mistake about it: when we remove God, impurity, degradation, and depravity take firm root in society.  It would be indeed foolish to suggest that all of the atrocities of our societies, past or present, can be laid at the feet of atheism. History has had more than its fair share of purported “believers” in God who have done horrific things to their fellowman- often even in the name of religion itself. It is, however, worthy of note that many individual cases of “religious” atrocities involve mental illness. It is not a belief in God that is to blame, but the mental illness/deficiency of the individual which is responsible. In fairness, mental instability is the real culprit behind some atheistic atrocities also.  But it is equally undeniable that when the critical mass of a society denies (or doubts) the very existence of God, or substitutes “a god” of their own making in His place, they are doomed to destruction- both here, and hereafter. Please note carefully 1Tim.1:8-11 , “But we know that the Law (meaning “God’s law”) is good, if one uses it lawfully, realizing that law is not made for a righteous man, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill fathers or mothers, for murderers and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching, according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.” Look at this list of unrighteousness again. Some of these are attributes our society tends to praise, if not glorify- like rebellion; some we have come to just plain expect from each other- like lying and perjury ; and some are the direct result of removing the very existence of God (and His Law) from our mindset- like immorality and homosexuality. When we remove the “righteous” God from our realm of reality, some very “unrighteous” activities are going to become commonplace in our society!  Our title includes “Practical Atheism”- so it needs to be addressed also. A story is told of several preachers in a town gathering at a local coffee shop one morning. The newest preacher in town sought to elevate his particular brand of religion by proudly announcing that they had recently baptized the town drunk. One of the old timers spoke up, “Yeah, we’ve all baptized him at one time or another- but it didn’t affect him much!” What I call a “Practical Atheist” is one who may actually claim to believe in God, but it “doesn’t affect him much” either! Unless our belief in God causes us to act in accordance with His Word, we are no better off (and may even be worse) than the demons. James 2:19-20 addresses this kind of “Practical Atheism” as follows, “You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder. But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless?” Practical Atheism gets you to exactly the same place as Atheism- without God, here and hereafter.  Here’s the point of all of this: the more we as a society remove, deny, and dismiss God, the worse things are going to get. We can’t deny God, and expect people to live godly. So, change people’s mind about God, or buckle up- it’s going to get rough."],"title":["The Effects of Atheism, and Practical Atheism"],"_resultNumber":79,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/the_effects_of_atheism_and_practical_atheism","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":79},{"body":["I am well aware that 1Timothy 6:10 says “the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil.” But evil has more than one root, and therefore the love of money is not the only tuber that can tap into our hearts to grow sinful fruits in our lives. In fact, there are many such “roots.” Passages like Galatians 5:19-21 give a pretty good list of some of the others. These we must pull out of, or chop off from, our hearts to produce lives filled with “the fruit of the Spirit.” However, I have become convinced that selfishness is a root of evil that yields a bountiful harvest of sinful attitudes and activities. It can and will destroy every relationship we seek to maintain- husband/wife, parent/child, work/business, friendships, and certainly our spiritual relationship with God and His people. But this isn’t just my opinion....   James 4:1-4 makes it pretty clear that the evil root of selfish desire causes multiple problems for us. He begins with the question, “What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you?” He then answers the question with a question: “Is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members?” When our own selfish pleasures take precedence in our lives, our relationship with our brethren will undoubtedly suffer. But James goes further in the next verse, “You lust and do not have; so you commit murder. And you are envious and cannot attain; so you fight and quarrel.” See how pervasive the evil root of selfishness can be? Verse 3 adds that our selfish desires prevent God from being able to grant our petitions- because His blessings would just be used “on your pleasures.” Finally, James adds that such a selfish attitude constitutes “friendship with the world” (because the world is selfishly motivated), the end result of which is that we become “an enemy of God.” What a cornucopia of sinful fruits come from this evil root of selfishness!  So what’s the solution? Philippians 2:1-4 provides several. First, be in “fellowship” with the Spirit rather than with the world, v.1 . That is, strive to be like God, Jesus, and the Spirit by being “selfless,” instead of being “selfish” like Satan and the world. Second, v.2 says to be “of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on purpose” with those who are “godly” rather than those who are “godless.” Not only should we be in fellowship with God, we should be in fellowship with God’s people. “Fellowship” means “joint participation.” We should thus be “jointly participating” with God’s people (rather than the world) in mind by studying God’s word together , in heart by having ours knit together with theirs in loving good and godly things , and in activity by practicing our faith together . Finally, v.3 commands that we “Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit” . How do we obey such a command? Again, answers are provided in the text: (1) “with humility of mind let each of you regard one another as more important than himself;” (2) “do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others;” and (3) “Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus…” Now, if we regard others as more important than ourselves, if we look out for the interests of others rather than just our own , and if we pattern our attitude and activities after the selfless example of Jesus, wouldn’t that pull the evil root of selfishness up, well…by the roots? It surely would!  Folks, if we eliminate the “roots” of our sinful behaviors, I think we’ll find that they “die on the vine” so to speak. Sorry for all the corny puns, but please consider carefully what the word of God says on the subject of selfishness. I am convinced that we cannot be both “selfish” and “Christian” at the same time, so these things are important."],"title":["The “Roots” of Evil"],"_resultNumber":80,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/the_roots_of_evil","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":80},{"body":["I have said many times before that “we humans don’t ‘create’ anything– we just assemble the pieces and parts God provides into other things.” It’s still true. Think about it. Even the most abstract thing we can imagine always seems to be made up of components that have a basis in reality. We’re still, even in our wildest imaginations, just putting existing bits together in a new or different way. We’re really not creating , though we are making, or forming .   It’s interesting that the Bible makes this same distinction. Notice that God “created the heavens and the earth.” ( Gen.1:1 ) He didn’t just assembled them from existing parts, He created them. The apostle Paul put it this way, “...God, who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist.”  ( Rom.4:17 ) What power! I know of no more graphic illustration of this point than the fact that by His absolute creative power, God said, “Let there be light” on first day of creation, Gen.1:3-5 , “and there was light.” OK, so? Now notice that He did not create the Sun and the Moon until the fourth day, Gen.1:14-19 ! Light was created and present for four days when there was no physical source of it! From where then did it emanate? Surely it came from the very being of God Himself! 1John 1:5 says that “God is light,” and Jas.1:17 calls Him the “Father of lights” .   But God also made or formed some parts of the world from things He previously created. Note again carefully a couple of verses from the creation account of Gen.1:6-7 , “Then God said, ‘Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters. And God made the expanse, and separated the waters which were below from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.” Here, God first created an expanse, then He further made it more specific by separating the waters below from the waters above . While this may not be the best example of the difference between creating and making/forming, think about another one. In Gen.2:7 , “The the Lord God formed man of the dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.” God had already created the dust, or dirt, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth .” ( Gen.1:1 ) Now, He takes some of the previously created earth, and forms or makes/molds it into man. Then, He creates life in the mass of man formed from the base elements of the earth– again, what immense power!    “OK– I get it: God is able to both create from nothing, and make or form existing materials into something new. So, what’s the point beyond this? That God can create while we humans just mold stuff?” Yes, but there’s more too.    God did not create Jesus. As a divine member of the Godhead, Jesus, like the Father and the Spirit, was and is eternal. Therefore, He has neither beginning nor end ( cf. Heb.7:3 ). But God did make or form (or even transform ) Jesus into something else. A man? Yes, but more to the point, a  sinful man -  “He  (the Father) made (formed or transformed) Him (Jesus) who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf…”    2Cor.5:21 . We know, because we are told by God, that Jesus “committed no sin” Himself, 1Pet.2:22 . And yet, God made Him “sin on our behalf.” That is, though He had no sins of His own, God made Jesus to be as a sinner by placing the burden and penalty of our sins upon Him. But why would He do such a thing?    Note the rest of 2Cor.5:21 , “that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” Get this: God  made  Jesus something that He was not–  sin  , that we might become something we are not-  righteous  ! Behold the power of God to make , mold , and transform ! He who has the power to create by calling into being that which does not exist, can surely transform you and I into something which we are not: righteous ! He certainly will not do so against our will, or without our participation by faith and obedience, but God can make any sinner righteous through the sacrifice of Jesus His Son. “Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify (Grk. hagiazo – to make free from the guilt of sin) entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass.” ( 1Thess.5:23-24 ) The Greek word from which “bring it to pass” is translated is “poieo”. Do you know how else this word is translated in other places? Poieo is often translated as “made” ! Here it means God will  make it so . By His transforming power , God will make our sanctification through Jesus entire and complete! He will form us into conformity with Him that we may abide with Him forever in heaven!    While these truths should not be taken as a license to sin so that more of God’s grace and power might be manifested in or to us  ( cf. Rom.6:1ff )  , it does provide great hope and encouragement. No matter how sinful we have become, if we will turn to God in faithful obedience to His word, He can and will make us fit for heaven.

The stations are pretty limited in a metal building, so the radio was tuned to one of only a couple of stations that would come in clearly. I wasn’t really listening, but the “host” caught my attention when he began to give parenting advice. Since the Bible also has good deal to say about this subject, my interested was piqued. He quoted unnamed studies that sought to quantify the harm done to children when their parents yell at them. But the logic fascinated me. Apparently, parents that forgo corporal punishment have a difficult time getting their children to respect and obey them. And since, according to the host, “time out” and “sending them to their room” often have little effect on their behavior, parents have increasingly resorted to yelling at their children. Evidently, the only “teeth” manifested in efforts to discipline their children are shown when yelling! The best that I could follow the point of the piece, the results of the study were that “yelling” might be just as detrimental to the psyche of a child as spanking. Go figure.  Don’t get me wrong- yelling is certainly not a good form of discipline. But, the lengths to which our evolved society will go to avoid the “wise counsel” of God on this subject is truly amazing. The book of Proverbs is replete with divinely inspired parenting guidance. It includes corporal punishment ( 13:24 ; 19:18 ; 22:15 ; 29:15-17 ), but contains so much more, cf. 1:8 – 7:27 ! What emerges from this and other biblical texts on effective discipline (training) is that it must include three elements: 1) education so that they know the right things; 2) encouragement so that they understand why these are the right things; and 3) enforcement so that the right things are obeyed. While the punitive aspect is vital to insure that non-compliance has unpleasant consequences, without the instructive and inspiring aspects, “discipline” soon becomes manipulative and tyrannical. No one is encouraging you to “beat” or “abuse” your children- such would surely violate Ephesians 6:4 ; Colossians 3:21 ; and the overall purpose of godly discipline. But remember, discipline without corrective and punitive measures is just advice!  Surely we understand these principles from everyday life. Who wants to live in a society without lawsthat specify and encourage right conduct, and law-enforcementthat punishes violators? Not me- such would be chaos! But sadly, chaos is exactly what exists in far too many homes where “enlightened” parents refuse to educate, encourage, and enforce discipline. Teachers are leaving schools in droves because they cannot teach children who have not been properly disciplined at home to be respectful and obedient.  But the strongest case that corrective/punitive measures are to be included in discipline comes from God’s treatment of His “children.” While the Old Testament certainly contains “rules” by which God’s children were  educated  in what was “right” and “wrong,” and it contains a multitude of examples wherein God  encouraged  them to understand and obey “for their own good” (as in Deuteronomy 6:3 ), it also is filled with examples of His enforcement of His laws through punitive measures ( see 1Corinthains 10:1-11 )! Did God not “love” His children? Wasn’t He afraid punishment would damage their psyche, or His relationship with them? Did He avoid punishment because He wanted His children to love rather than fear Him? Hebrews 12:5-11 makes it crystal clear that God disciplines, including punitively, His children precisely  because  He loves and wants the best for them!  There should be no doubt that love is a better motivator than fear.  1Corinthians 13:13 says that love is even greater than faith and hope . But, our “perfect Parent,” God the Father, also utilizes punitive discipline, and the fear of it, to help enforce right conduct until love and respect can develop and grow as we mature. Why else does He tell us of the horrors of hell in Mark 9:42-48 , or of His past punishment of angels, cities, and the whole world in 2Peter 2:4-6 ?  Should children “fear” their parents? Not unless and until they violate the training their parents have instilled through education and encouragement- then they should fear the punitive results of their own conduct their parents lovingly but consistently employ! But this is just the example and instruction of the Creator of the Universe. Obviously our evolved and enlightened society surely knows better…. and continues to reap the unfortunate and disastrous results of it everyday!"],"title":["Parents, Children, and Discipline"],"_resultNumber":82,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/parents_children_and_discipline","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":82},{"body":["The question of our title is admittedly lifted from its context in 2Peter 3:11 . The sentence from which this questioning phrase is taken is not really even a question as much as it is a rhetorical statement. But the purloined part is exactly what I’d like us to consider, so please forgive the poaching. Think about the query posed, “What sort of people ought you to be?” Though Peter surely meant it to be both personally instructional and introspective, consider it relative to your children . Let’s rephrase it as, “What sort of people ought  your children  to be?”  It’s all too easy to give overly simplistic and platitudinous answers to this kind of question, such as, “I want my children to be good Christians ”- though we may not be really sure how to define a “good” Christian vs. a “bad” one. The end productof our child-rearing efforts should be Christ-like adults. If we don’t have this goal firmly fixed in  our  minds as we lead and direct them when they’re young, it is very difficult for  them  to become “the sort of people they ought to be” as adults. To that end, think with me about a few core-principles and values that will help them to be children that we can proud of now, and adults that God will be proud to claim later. Obviously, even the best parenting efforts can be undone by rebellious adult offspring, cf. Hosea 7:13-15 , but surely we can make every effort to help our little ones to be:    Cooperative rather than Competitive . We have turned the world into such a competitive place that each one thinks that he has to “get ahead” of everyone else. In the process we’ve forgotten how to cooperate with one another - “Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor,”  Ecclesiastes 4:9 . Children who are taught to be excessively competitive tend to put down and demean others to illustrate their own presumed superiority rather than encouraging and helping them in a spirit of cooperation and mutual accomplishment, cf. Hebrews 12:12-13 . Unless we steer them differently, they will lack basic compassion and tend to be overly critical of others and their perceived short-comings (where would they possibly learn that?). It’s no surprise therefore, that employers are constantly searching for applicants who can “work well with others”!    Humble rather than Haughty . Perhaps these are linked to, or even stem from, the previous pair. Cooperation requires humility (biblically, humility refers to regarding others as more important than self,  cf. Philippians 2:3 ), but an overly competitive nature often belies selfishness, and promotes arrogance and haughtiness. It seems that currently, our competitive natures not only demand that we defeat our competitors, but that we also demean and belittle them and arrogantly tout ourselves in the process. Is this really the “sort of people we ought to be”?    Helpful rather than Harmful. Some people will “go out of their way” to help others, and some will “go out of their way” to harm others. These traits don’t just “show-up” in adults. Instead, they are instilled by the education, example, and encouragement of their parents in people when they are children, either positively or negatively. Children are taught to be abusive or assistive toward others and their property, and both are the result of underlying attitudes. Abusive behaviors often stem from failures to be taught proper respect for others and their property. A generation (or two?) has been so overdosed on self-respect and positive self-images that perhaps many have become “self-centered,” and have thus lost the proper regard for others.   Demure rather than Demanding. “Demure” is not a common word in most of our vocabularies. It is an adjective that basically refers to being modest. “Modesty” is often (correctly) associated with clothing, but has just as much to do with our attitudes and how we conduct ourselves. The demure or modest person doesn’t demand everyone’s attention, nor expect everyone to bow to his/her wishes. Like all the other negative traits covered, we teach our children, or encourage or allow them, to become demanding of their own way and our attention. Proverbs 30:31a warned of the outcome of such, “The leech has two daughters, ‘Give,’ ‘Give.’” We can teach our children to be demure or demanding- but we will reap the harvest of the seed we sow.  Surely there are other attributes that will, if taught and encouraged in our children, help them grow into Christ-like adults. If we want our children to be mature, independent, kind, trustworthy, gracious, and loving people, we have to teach them to be the same kind of children."],"title":["“What Sort of People Ought You to Be”?"],"_resultNumber":83,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/what_sort_of_people_ought_you_to_be","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":83},{"body":["What's the only thing that is \"completely yours\"? Click the title and read on.   Think about it carefully. What really belongs to you and you alone?    It’s not your spouse– they are, and have to be, their own person. One human being can’t really belong to another in the absolute sense.    It’s not even your children. You may have given them life, but you gave it to them . Therefore, their lives must at some point become their own . And by the way, as parents we have to let that happen and be OK with it. We do have to wait until they’re mature enough to handle it, but it has to happen. But even in saying these things, there are ways in which all of us must admit that our lives are not completely our own. We are not completely free in this regard either.    Some might be prone to answer the question by saying something along the lines of, “Well, it’s my body, and I can certainly do with or to it what I want!”   Really? Your body?

Where’d you get your personality, mental abilities/limitations, etc.?    To some degree at least, where’d you get your habits, likes, and dislikes?

We speak of having “her daddy’s eyes,” “her mother’s good looks,” “his grandfather’s temper,” “his grandmother’s patience,” ad infinitum.  As I think about it, we only possess one thing that is truly ours. One thing that is completely independent of everyone and everything. One thing that is completely ours to do with as we please. One thing that we didn’t inherit, and that no one or no thing can take from us: our soul!   It is true that others can influence– either positively or negatively, what we do with our souls, but it is still ours and the decisions regarding what to do with it are up to us. It is our one eternal possession. Everything else, and I do mean everything else, is temporary. God gives us a soul and it is ours for eternity. Not only does He give us one forever, He gives us complete control over it. We don’t have to do anything with it we don’t want to. We can nurture and protect it, or we can abuse and neglect it. But remember, it’s yours forever and it’s the only one you’re going to get!    What will you/are you doing with your   only true and everlasting possession?     “What will a man be profited, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?

For instance, classical music is not on the list of things I enjoy. I wasn’t exposed to it in my formative years; which is really OK with me, I’m really not complaining here. I never learned to play an instrument of any kind. I can play a radio, if it works right and doesn’t have too many buttons! So, the complicated chords and rhythms of classical music really don’t appeal to me. I can’t sing along with it, whistle, hum, or tap my foot to it. None of which means that I’m unimpressed with the dedication and talent of those who can play it, or that I’m somehow prejudiced against the snobs (just teasing!) who spend countless hours enjoying it. I just haven’t been trained, nor have I trained myself, to truly appreciate classical music. So I don’t enjoy it.   If we can understand that simple illustration, perhaps we can see why so many people “get nothing out of” worship services...   The probable cause is that they haven’t been trained to appreciate them. They were not exposed to them as children, at least not properly exposed. Even if you were “taken to church” as a youth, did your parents demonstrate the attitude of the Psalmist, “I was glad when they said, ‘Let us go to the house of the Lord.’” ( Psalm 122:1 )? Or was it more like, “Come on Johnny, we  have to  go to church, and I’m going to tan your hide if you make us late or misbehave!”? Children learn to appreciate and enjoy what they’re taught to appreciate and enjoy. They also often learn to appreciate and enjoy what they see their parents appreciating and enjoying. If assembling with the saints is a “have to” task you participate in only begrudgingly and when it is convenient, it will likely never be anything more for your children. If you “pass the time” in services by watching and/or playing with babies, doing your nails, sighing, sleeping, or constantly going to the restroom or water fountain, services will likely never truly be “worship” for your children either.  Worship is supposed to be a pleasurable experience. Unfortunately, some who realize this fact and yet recognize that it isn’t so for many folks have sought to make New Testament worship into something God never intended it to be: entertainment. Instead of teaching and training people to appreciate and enjoy the true worship of God, we’ve made the services about us. We want it to be more dramatic, so we add drama. We want it to be more fun, so we add entertainment. We want it to be more emotional, so we add elements to stir the emotions. As the old timers might say, “We’re chewing on the hind-leg of the problem here!” New Testament “worship” doesn’t need propping up with gimmicks and tricks. The problem isn’t with the “worship”- it is with the “worshippers” who are more dedicated to themselves than to God. When our services are dictated by “what we like” instead of by “what God said” we’re on the wrong track! Ask yourself this question: If our worship innovations are such good ideas, why didn’t God think of and provide for them in the New Testament? Did we really think God didn’t know how He was best worshipped? Listen closely to John 4:23 , “…true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshippers.”   God never promised to accept anything and everything we give to Him just because we call it “worship.” That notion didn’t fly under the Old Law (read Malachi ), and it won’t work under the New Testament either. We can’t do what pleases us and call it “worship”- God defines how we should worship Him. Instead of trying to cater to the whims of our carnally-minded selves, why not learn to appreciate and enjoy: (1) reading and studying God’s divine Word together, 1Timothy 4:13-16 ; (2) singing praises to His great name with emotion and understanding, Colossians 3:16 ; (3) blending our hearts together in earnest prayer and petition to the Almighty who loves us, 1Timothy 2:1-8 ; (4) generously and thankfully returning a portion of that with which He has blessed us to Him, 1Corinthians 16:1-2; 2Corinthians 9:6-7 ; and (5) commemorating the blessed and holy sacrifice of Jesus Christ by partaking the emblems that represent His precious body and blood, 1Corinthians 11:23-34 ? We can do all of these things in a spirit of true appreciation, deep emotion, and glorious praise if we try.

Apparently, almost anything can be a part of a fellowship and church work or worship if “God didn’t say not to do it.” Let’s think about that logic and reason for a moment....  When giving Noah instructions for building an ark through which he and his family could be saved from the coming destruction of those who were unwilling to obey God, the Lord didn’t forbid him from using pine, oak, cedar, maple, sycamore, cypress, etc. Instead, God just told Noah what type of wood he could use , and that automatically eliminated the rest, Gen.6:14ff . God was silent on these other kinds of wood because He specified the type of wood He wanted Noah to use.  Likewise, when God specified through Moses that priests had to come from the tribe of Levi, Deut.33:8-11 , He didn’t have to forbid the tribes of Rueben, Simeon, Issachar, Dan, Naphtali, Judah, etc. All the other tribes were necessarily excluded when God specified Levi as the priestly tribe, cf. Heb.7:14 . God was silent on these other tribes because He had specified the tribe He wanted to serve as priests.  As priests, Nadab and Abihu were to keep fire burning on the altar of the Lord continuously, Lev.6:12-13 ; and fire used for other sacrifices and offerings was to be taken from this altar, Lev.16:12 . So, they were killed by God when they “offered strange fire before the Lord, which He had not commanded them,”  Lev.10:1-2 . Did God need to say, “Don’t use fire from here, or here, or there”? Not at all- when He told the priests from where the fire needed to come, every other place and source was automatically eliminated. God was silent on “other fire” because He had specified the fire He wanted to be used.  Now, let’s make a specific application of these things (though the same principles should guide all other applications also!). Most religions of today use instruments of music to praise God in worship. If asked why they choose to worship in this way, the answer is often, “God didn’t say not to use it.” Can’t we see that God didn’t tell Noah “not to use cedar,” or tell Israel “not to make priests from the tribe of Rueben,” or tell Nadab and Abihu “not to use fire from some other source” either? But God does tell us what “instruments” to use to praise Him in Ephesians 5:19 , “ speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;”. The  voice  and the  heart  were the instruments specified-not the violin and harp.  The objection usually raised to this is, “But they used instrumental music to praise God in the Old Testament!” They sure did, but please answer this question: “ Why did they use instrumental music in the Old Testament to praise God?” 2Chronicles 29:25 provides the answer, “He stationed the Levites in the house of Lord with cymbals, with harps, and lyres, according to the command of David and of Gad the king’s seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for the command was from the Lord through His prophets.” God specified instrumental music for Jews under the Law of Moses in the Old Testament. We are Christians under the Law of Christ in the New Testament. Where is God’s specification of instruments of music besides the voice and the heart in the New Testament?  “But weren’t the first Christians Jews?” Absolutely, and yet any reputable historian or bible encyclopedia will tell you that mechanical music was not a part of Christian worship until late in the seventh century A.D. when Pope Vitalian decreed it as an acceptable form of worship. Overwhelmingly, instrumental music in worship was rejected by all the major Protestant denominations (and their leaders such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, Charles Spurgeon, and John Wesley) until the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. But more importantly, why did Jewish Christians, who were accustomed to using mechanical instruments to worship God under the Old Testament Law, suddenly abandon the use of them in Christian worship? Again, the answer is simple: “Neither God, Jesus, nor the Holy Spirit (or men inspired by Them) authorized the use of mechanical instruments in the New Testament for Christian worship.” There was no need to say (or write), “Don’t use this or that mechanical instrument” because God had specified the voices and hearts of Christians singing praises to Him. There are at least nine N.T. passages that specify  singing  praises to God, Matthew 26:30 ; Acts 16:25 ; Romans 15:9 ; 1Corinthians 14:15 ; Ephesians 5:19 ; Colossians 3:16 ; Hebrews 2:12 and 13:15 ; and James 5:13 . But, though mechanical instruments were readily available, and had been a part of Jewish worship, there is not one N.T. passage that specifies using one (or several) for Christian worship. Apparently, early Christians understood that the silence of God did not authorize this, or any other practice. Does it really make that much difference? Ask Nadab and Abihu. Please study, reflect, and think on these things carefully."],"title":["What God Hasn’t Said"],"_resultNumber":87,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/what_god_hasnt_said","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":87},{"body":["Which is more important? Are they mutually exclusive ?   My wife loves these decorating shows on T.V. She’s always wanting me (as the one truly in charge of the remote control as any real man should be!) to check and see what’s on the Home & Garden channel or one of those other women’s channels just as the WWII movie is getting to the good part, or John Wayne is about to shoot or slug the bad guy! And as a “real man” I usually tell her “no” and then change the channel to the one she suggested! But one thing about it, I’ve learned the lingo of these kinds of shows– through over-exposure no doubt. [So, please don’t use the “whimsy” or “whimsical” around me as this is the most irritating of all the vocabulary peculiar to these shows.] But, as in most things, even these women’s shows can have some beneficial ideas when applied spiritually. Here’s what I mean….     One of the things I hear discussed on these design/decorating shows (not that I really listen or watch with any interest, mind you) is the challenge of balancing form with function  . Designs or decorating patterns that are more function-oriented are said to be “utilitarian” and usually frowned upon by the fru-fru divas of design. By contrast, the designs or decorating trends that are often portrayed seem to be overly conscience of style or form , but lacking in usability. They may look great to the design team, but you know from practical experience that they won’t work in a “real” family environment. Thus the challenge of form vs. function.     Christianity is not immune from this challenge. All too often perhaps, we can become overly concerned, if not outright obsessed, with form over function. Paul, after listing what we would consider a whole bunch of heinous offenses, said that such people were “holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power” ( 2Tim.3:1-5 ). Despite being either the possessors or practitioners of these overtly sinful attitudes and actions, they claimed for themselves the “form” of Christianity– hypocritically, of course. Likewise, Jesus was often chided by the divas of doctrine in His day, as well as questioned by His disciples, about how what He was doing “looked”. They were concerned about the form of Him eating with sinners rather than the function of Him saving them!     Our challenges today don’t differ much in substance from these types of examples. Most have roots that stretch deep into the mother-earth of the shallowness of our spiritual commitment. Because we lack spiritual dedication and a heart of discipleship, we become overly concerned with what “others” think and do rather than the “right thing” to think and do.  And so our “worship services” become more about entertaining “us” and “them” than worshipping Him. Likewise, our private lives become tainted with the desire to “fit in” with those who we ought to be mercifully convicting of sin and lovingly converting to Christ.     Look, Christianity isn’t all utilitarian. Properly practiced, it truly is a beautiful thing to behold. But it’s even more pleasing to the senses when it is practiced rather than just seen in others. Don’t become too concerned with what the pop-culture of religion today thinks- do the right thing(s) in worship and daily living anyway! It really is more important."],"title":["Form or Function"],"_resultNumber":88,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/form_or_function","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":88},{"body":["This article is not about child rearing, per se. The spiritual condition of your physical children is not its focus. Instead, please consider spiritual children in the light of 1Corinthians 4:15 where Paul wrote, “For if you were to have countless tutors in Christ, yet you would not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.”  This is precisely the meaning intended.  Having physical children changes us. Perhaps for the first time in our lives, we learn what true, selfless love is really all about. Up to that point, we’ve probably lived mostly for ourselves. But that little “bundle of joy” hopefully brings about major changes in our minds with regard to how we think, our hearts with regard to how we feel, and our lives with regard to how we conduct ourselves. Such is natural and good, because if we haven’t done so yet, these changes force us to grow up or mature. But this is in the physical realm- what about spiritual children?   Having spiritual children, in the sense of which Paul wrote to the Corinthians, instead of forcing us to grow up spiritually, is most often the  result  of spiritual maturity. Think about the comparison. In the physical (purely biological) realm, the life-cycle typically is as follows: 1) Seed Implantation; 2) Conception; 3) Gestation; 4) Birth; 5) Growth/Development; 6) Maturity; 7) Reproduction; 8) Parental Care of Offspring; and finally, 9) Death. But some how, in the spiritual realm, we tend to associate maturity simply with chronology since birth, rather than with reproduction and the parental care given to spiritual offspring. The reason for this is very simple. Most Christians never become spiritual parents becausethey never reproduce themselves spiritually!   Without this spiritual maturity (either from or because of having spiritual children ), we don’t get that all-so-important change of mind with regard to how we think in spiritual terms . We don’t get that vital change of heart with regard to how we feel in spiritual terms. And, we don’t get that imperative change of life with regard to how we live and conduct ourselves in spiritual terms. Basically, we never really “grow up” spiritually! Paul also addressed this issue to the Corinthians, “And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men , but…. as to babes in Christ,”   1Corinthians 3:1ff  . Even a casual read of 1Corinthians leaves us with the indelible impression that most, if not all, of their “problems” were directly tied to their selfish spiritual immaturity.  Please think this through. How many current congregational/church problems would be resolved if the membership were, at least in part, spiritual parents (had spiritual children in the congregation)? Wouldn’t we be more tolerant and understanding of the mistakes children typically make if they were our  spiritual children, or the spiritual children of family members ,  1Thessalonians 5:14  ? Wouldn’t we be more careful with regard to what we (and others) say about church leadership or other family members when the immature ears of our  spiritual children were listening, 1Thessalonians 5:12-13 ? Wouldn’t we be more concerned with how we treat one another in front of our  spiritual children,  1Thessalonians 5:15 ? Wouldn’t we be more diligent with regard to the growth and development opportunities within the congregation if it included our  spiritual children,  Hebrews 12:14-17 ?  I’m not suggesting that having “babes in Christ” in the congregation will solve every problem that arises in a local fellowship. I am suggesting that: 1) spiritual maturity is not the mere product of years of wearing out pew cushions, but should instead be associated with the maturity necessary to produce and rear spiritual children; 2) reproducing ourselves spiritually helps us to become selflessly mature rather than remaining selfishly immature; and, 3) when congregations are comprised of significant numbers of spiritual parents , many of the problems arising from spiritual immaturity (most congregational problems) aren’t allowed to fester and destroy the faith of their spiritual children.  There is one more point that deserves consideration. When physical parents have two children, the overall population will remain static because they’ve simply replaced themselves. The same is true in the spiritual realm if we convert only our “two” physical children. Furthermore, if we content ourselves to be spiritually barren, the kingdom of God on earth is on a path of diminishing returns that nears extinction with each passing generation."],"title":["“Spiritual Children”"],"_resultNumber":89,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/spiritual_children","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":89},{"body":["We’ve all heard it, and most of us have said it. Being thankful is always the right thing to do, but the admonition to “  Just  be thankful” is often advice given to someone who has suffered some heartbreak, disappointment, or accident. It is then that a kind soul who means well, and intends to provide a dose of needed perspective, says, “Just be thankful that…” and then adds some worse alternative which didn’t happen.  As I was driving to Tyler to haul home a broken down vehicle that had just been released from the repair shop the day before (and had both an engine and front axle rebuilt in the recent past also), my frustrations begin to mount. Self “pity party” lines rolled and wrapped through my mind. With four drivers in the family operating mostly older vehicles with high mileage, it seems we always have a vehicle (or three!) needing repair. Then it hit me: On the scale of personal difficulties and tragedies, a broken down vehicle has to be near the bottom of the problem list, if even on it at all. I was immediately both ashamed of my frustration and thankful for  my  problem(s). Others are being forced to combat diseases trying to kill their children, or struggling to understand why a loved one died far too prematurely, or trying to repair their lives after some personal tragedy- but I was despairing over a fourteen year old vehicle breaking down! So I said it, first to myself, and then out loud to family members: “Just be thankful that a broken down old car isour biggest problem!” Perspective is a wonderfully cheering and immensely liberating thing.  So, “Just be thankful” if:  · Your car is broken, because that means you have one, and it can probably be repaired, if not replaced. This is one of those problems that time or money or the combination of the two can fix. While you may not have the money now, in time, you can have it. There are a lot more serious problems that these two fixers can’t resolve- so, “Just be thankful…”  · Your parents, children, or family members are driving you crazy, because that means you still have them. I can’t imagine how difficult it must be to have lost an immediate family member prematurely and tragically- but many can because they’re still dealing with the aftermath. So, “Just be thankful…”  · Your bills are piling up, because that probably means you’ve lived sufficiently well enough to enjoy credit, and the things and activities it can buy, but for which repayment is required. And if you’re electricity bill is out of control, you can always simply have the power company remove the meter. People survived for centuries without electricity. See? Things can always be worse- so, “Just be thankful…”  · Your aches, pains, and physical difficulties seemingly require your constant attention, because that means no one has yet “thrown dirt in your face” (buried you). Our physical bodies were never meant to last forever, and will surely break down eventually. But, while there is breath, there is hope. In physical terms, this means there is “life” still be lived- do your best to make the most of and enjoy it. In spiritual terms, while there is breath means there is the opportunity to get right with God, and thus become prepared for the “life” that is to come. So, “Just be thankful…”  · You realize you’ve made a mess of your life, because that means you’ve taken the first step toward straightening things out- with God’s grace and help of course. In Luke 15 , the prodigal son’s first step toward reconciliation with his father was realizing and admitting his mistakes, “I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight,”  v.18 . We can never make a “mess” God can’t clean up, if we will realize and admit our mistakes, and return to Him in true repentance. If you’ve come to realize that you’re living in the pigsty of sin, you’ve started in the right direction and now have the opportunity to do, and be, better. So, “Just be thankful…”  Even in disappointment, heartbreak, and tragedy, there are always things for which we can, and should be, thankful. Therefore, “in everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus,”  1Thessalonians 5:18 ."],"title":["“Just Be Thankful…”"],"_resultNumber":90,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/just_be_thankful","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":90},{"body":["Is that the way you feel about “the holidays” and all the other stuff that seems to go with them? Is it a relief for you too when everything returns to its normal levels of chaos rather than the hyper-chaos of the last few weeks? Don’t get me wrong, it’s great to see and have opportunities to be with family, but it’s also good to get back to more normal routines. After three family gatherings and various other celebrations, and officiating at both a funeral and a wedding, I’m glad to be back in the office working on “normal” stuff. All of which got me to thinking (a dangerous situation, I know), wasn’t modern technology supposed to make our lives easier and simpler?  Wasn’t it supposed to give us more time to spend with our families, and more time for relaxing and recreating? Instead, these advances seem to have complicated our lives further. For instance, a friend of mine had to take his cell phone over to his mother’s the other day to charge it up because the battery was dead, and the electricity was off at his house. Her power was off too, but she had an automatic generator!  I’m not against technology- my goodness I’m writing this article on a computer with two big screens while my Bible software program is running and I exchange emails with multiple church members, and as my favorite music is streaming through the speakers over the internet! I’m just saying that some of these devices that are supposed to make our lives easier sometimes wind up taking a lot of time and attention to keep running. “Yes,” I remember when there was a rotary-dial phone in the house that worked whether the electricity was on or not. And “no” I don’t want to go back to that time because I also remember that it was connected to a “party line” that you often had to wait several minutes to be able to use. (Young readers can ask the old folks what “rotary phones” and “party lines” are!) Technology, no doubt, has made many aspects of our lives unquestionably better. My “beef” is instead with the lack of wisdom we employ in utilizing the benefits of technology.  If we use the “time-saving” advantages of technology to just cram more into our over-crowded schedules, which inevitably require even more technology to accommodate, then pretty soon virtually everything we do will require computer chips and the internet….wait, that’s about where we are now! Consider instead some words of wisdom from the Holy Spirit through the Apostle Paul,  “…make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and attend to your own business and work with your hands, just as we commanded you; so that you may behave properly toward outsiders and not be in any need.”  ( 1Thessalonians 4:11-12 ) In most of our thought processes, the words  “ambition”  and  “quiet life”  never intersect. In fact, for many of us, the concepts of “ambition” and a “quiet life” seem diametrically opposed to one another. And yet, Paul urged the brethren in Thessalonica to have as their  “ambition”  (from a Greek word meaning “to strive earnestly, make it one’s aim”) a  “quiet life”  (meaning in part, “to rest, cease from labor….not running hither and thither”)!  Based on the hectic nature of our schedules, and the wisdom of God expressed through Paul, some of us may need to re-evaluate our “ambitions” in life. While the holidays were all too busy for my liking, the time I enjoyed the most involved a complete absence of technology. Donna (my “Babydoll” of 25 years), Austin (our 20 year old son who was home from college), Logan (our younger son, a senior at JHS), and I spent an afternoon out on our land south of town. We “killed” a whole slew of paper plates and drink cans with a wide variety of firearms, but then settled down around a campfire. We cooked chili dogs with all the “fixins.” But the best part was just spending several hours outside, around a campfire, laughing and talking. It was the highlight of my holiday - just being together and enjoying simple times and things . Despite all the earlier gunfire, it was a “quiet time”- the kind for which perhaps more of us ought to “aim” given God’s words to the Thessalonians….and us. What’s your “ambition” for you and your family?

Dad was the Ag teacher at the country school, and we lived on ten acres a couple of miles away. But up the road, a few more miles further out, was “the farm.” It was about 100 acres where there were a few head of cattle, a couple of horses, the garden (more like a truck crop!), and plenty of work to be done building/repairing fences, cutting firewood, brush-hogging, mowing, and clearing land. When Donna and I married, we lived on the hill at the upper end overlooking the rest of the farm. It was beautiful, quiet, and idyllic. Then came the preaching....  The first couple of congregations with which I worked were country churches, so we continued to live on the farm, or in one case, rented a country home from one of the members that was much closer to the building. Then we worked with a couple of “city churches,” and had to move to town. This was somewhat of an adjustment- people actually walked through our yard on a sidewalk, which was a new experience, but we adjusted. However, when the opportunity arose to move back to East Texas, we wanted a place of our own to finish raising our boys.  So, through the local brethren’s generosity, we were able to look for a home of our own- the first one since we left “the farm” some fourteen years earlier. If we were going to live “in town,” it was important to me to at least have space, so we wound up purchasing a home in an older neighborhood with a large lot- just under two acres. Although it doesn’t have a sidewalk, it does have a curb and gutter by the street. Since it is a large lot, it has a two hundred sixty-five foot curb/gutter (yes, I measured). Thus began the battle to keep the grass and dirt in the yard instead of the gutter!  The other day, I was performing what I try to limit to a “once” or “twice a year” project of shoveling the dirt out of the gutter that seems to collect there from all over the place. I hate this job. It’s hard work made more so by years spent sitting at a desk with my head in the Book. My hands have become far too accustomed to a computer keyboard, and my back to a comfy office chair, to be good at operating a shovel and wheelbarrow anymore! But there I was, covered in sweat from the cuffs of my shirtsleeves to my socks, shoveling dirt, gravel, and grass out of the gutter. When I took a break to cool off and catch my breath, I plopped down on the bank with my feet in the gutter and my head on my knees. Then it happened. A very nice lady stopped, rolled down her window, and asked, “Are you alright?” Somewhat disgusted with my lack of stamina (from eating too well and sweating too little), I replied, “No Ma’am, I need someone to finish this job for me!” Shocked, I’m sure, she said, “Oh, well, that’s not me.” Then she smiled, rolled up her window, and drove away. It was sweet of her to stop and check on me. But, this little episode got me to thinking….  In our lives as Christians, we all need someone to care enough to take the time and trouble to stop what they’re doing long enough to simply ask, “Are you OK?” If this dear lady’s care and concern invigorated and motivated me to get up and finish the task at hand, despite my disgust at my weakness and lack of endurance, how much more so is it important for us to do the same for one another in the “race that is set before us” as Christians? Whether it is through infirmity, weakness, or just generally being “out of spiritual shape,” we all get tired and discouraged at times. Someone being concerned enough to just ask, “Are you OK?” can be a real boost. It can motivate us to get up, get busy, and finish the job!  It is so very easy to become so involved with “our own little” world of tasks and troubles, that we fail to take the time to notice someone else that might need just to know we care. She didn’t have to get out of her vehicle, take the shovel, and finish loading the wheelbarrow for me. She just cared enough to stop and express concern. “And we urge you, brethren… encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with all men… always seek after that which is good for one another and for all men,”  1Thessalonians 5:14-15 . Remember the song we sometimes sing, “There is room in the kingdom of God, my brother, for the small things that you can do; just a small, kindly deed that may cheer another is the work God has planned for you.” Thank-you, Ma’am, you made my day!"],"title":["Care and Concern"],"_resultNumber":92,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/care_and_concern","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":92},{"body":["I grew up (to the extent I did) the son of vocational agriculture teacher and lived on a farm, so doing “no work at all” has never been part of my life experience. I think my first “away from home job” cutting and bailing hay was during the summer that I was thirteen, and then started a “real” job at a tractor and equipment auction the following year. Since then, I have been “out of work” for almost a full week in about 35 years. Now, I could get fired tomorrow (or even today!) and perhaps be without a job for an extended period before securing another one. But such would result from someone else’s choice rather than mine! On the other hand, folks who choose to do “no work at all” are an entirely different matter.  There is a huge difference between those who can’t work and those who won’t work. However, exactly where that line of “disability” begins is pretty subjective. I’ve seen a man with one leg and crutches (no prosthetic) mowing his yard with a push mower! I’ve also known of people with a “disability” for which they received governmental support who could out-work or out-play me physically any day of the week! The difference is often simply “want to”- which is probably just another way of saying “pride plus motivation.” The one-legged man was too proud to allow others to do for him what he felt he could do for himself. Conversely, there are many in our society who are more than willing for others to do for them what they could and should be doing for themselves!  The New Testament has a simple solution for this problem, “  For even when we were with you, we gave you this command : Anyone unwilling to work should not eat . For we hear that some of you are living in idleness, mere busybodies, not doing any work. Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living . Brothers and sisters, do not be weary in doing what is right. Take note of those who do not obey what we say in this letter; have nothing to do with them , so that they may be ashamed ,”  2Thessalonians 3:10-14 . Let those words really sink in, especially the ones in bold print. Following this “command” of the Lord will solve a lot of problems. But a cautionary reminder is in order: this passage is talking about those who are  unwilling  to work, rather than those who are  unable  to work.  However, this article is not really about social commentary or reform. It just so happens that congregations often contain the same problems in them that are common in society. Churches are all too often filled with capable people who are more than willing to sit back and reap the benefits of others’ labor without lifting a finger themselves. Just to be clear: Churches, like society, have far too many members who are  unwilling to work , but are not  unable to work!   These are those who expect the building to be immaculately clean, but don’t mind leaving “their pew” scattered with hymnals and trash. They also expect there to be “good” bible classes available for adults and children, but never bother to sign-up to teach one, or “work” toward preparing themselves to do so. They are happy when visitors attend, and enjoy having big crowds at services, but never quite get around to inviting or bringing anyone themselves. Theylike “inspiring and uplifting” worship services but don’t really participate by “singing from the heart,” or by taking a leading role in any aspect of the worship. They think the church ought to “do something with/for the young people,” but are never the ones hosting a class or get-together for them. They…. never mind, you get the point.  While many of us are all for “if any will not work, neither let him eat” in the world, it might be another thing entirely for the same principle to be enforced in the local church. Isn’t such thinking a goose and gander kind of thing? But think about it: What if those not “working” in the church were somehow prevented from enjoying the benefits of anyone else’s labor in it? If we understand and favor the rule for others with regard to secular work, shouldn’t we also be willing to abide by in the spiritual work of the Lord?"],"title":["“Doing No Work at All…”"],"_resultNumber":93,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/doing_no_work_at_all","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":93},{"body":["Let’s start with a confession: Last week’s article on “Love and Trust” was at least somewhat foundational and preparatory for this one (and next week’s too). We needed to be aware of the importance of love and trust to any relationship we sustain before considering this question: “What is the single most important factor in determining whether one is lost or saved?”    Obviously, “sin” is the cause for anyone being lost- but that is not exactly the point of the question. Surely everyone sins, or at least has sinned, Romans 3:23 ; and sin separates us from God both here and eternally, Isaiah 59:1-2 . But, it is also obvious that not everyone who has sinned will be eternally lost, 1Corinthians 6:9-11 . “Sin,” therefore, and perhaps somewhat surprisingly, is not the single most important factor determining whether one is lost or saved.   “Jesus Christ” must be the answer. Actually, it isn’t. Don’t get me wrong- no one can be saved without the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ, Ephesian 1:7 ! But, Jesus loved and sacrificed Himself for everyone, Romans 8:32 . However, everyone won’t be saved, Matthew 7:13-14 . So, neither is He the real determining factor between salvation and condemnation.  Then surely the answer must be, “Truth!” The word of God must be the most important factor in determining whether one is lost or saved. After all, “The truth shall set you free!” Actually, quoting only half of John 8:32 has given many folks a false impression. Jesus’ whole sentence is, “ If you abide in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine; and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” So then, the truth itself doesn’t set anyone “free” apart from his or her knowledge of and obedience to it. The truth cannot be the determining factor because the gospel is given “to every one,”  Romans 1:16 , but not everyone will be saved by it, cf. John 12:48 .  And while we’re at it, no “church” is the determining factor as to whether one is saved or lost either. Of course it’s true that churches either teach Truth by “handling accurately the word of truth,”  2Timothy 2:15 ; or, they espouse as “their doctrines the precepts of men,”  Matthew 15:9 . But this, of itself does not determine whether or not anyone is saved or lost. Churches, through their faithful or unfaithful teaching, may well influence whether souls are saved or lost, but are not the single most important determining factor.  So, if it is not sin, Jesus Christ, Truth, or even a/the church, what is the single most important factor in determining whether one is saved or lost? Note carefully the specific reason 2Thessalonians 2:10 provides as to why “those who perish” will be lost: “because they did not receive the love of truth so as to be saved.” Please understand why this is the answer to our question. “Sin” condemns everyone because all sin,  Romans 5:12 ; but we don’t have to live in sin, or even with its consequences, vv.21 – 6:23 . Through “Jesus Christ,” God’s grace providesthe instructions for all men to be saved, Titus 2:11-14 ; but instructions only benefit those who follow them. “Truth” indeed saves, but only when it is known and obeyed,  John 8:31-32 . The “church” doesn’t save anyone; it is the product/result of people being saved, Acts 2:41,47 . But, we overcome sin through Jesus Christ when we know and obey the Truth and are thus added to the church (the body of the saved). What is at the beginning of this string? What determines whether or not we progress all the way to salvation? Listen again to Paul’s words to the Thessalonians regarding those who perish: “because they did not receive the love of truth so as to be saved.”   As we indicated last week, any human relationship must have love and trust at its foundation. We cannot build a relationship with God without these same elements. But how do we manifest love and trust to God, and have confidence in our relationship with Him? “And by this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments,”  1John 2:3 . It is not enough to just say we love God, Matthew 7:21 ; we must  love His word enough to obey it. Failing to love the truth so as to be saved” is the single most important factor in determining our salvation, or condemnation. Do you love truth enough read it, study it, and understand and obey it? Or, are you just giving “lip service” to your love for God and His word? Think carefully- y our  soul hangs in the balance."],"title":["Loving the Word"],"_resultNumber":94,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/loving_the_word","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":94},{"body":["There are many characteristics and attributes that make a clear distinction between “man” and “beast”. Obviously, and perhaps most importantly, “man” was created “in the image of God,”  Genesis 1:26 , and thus possesses qualities that separate him from the animal kingdom. And from that same passage, it should also be noted that man was given “dominion” to “rule over” all the animals that God placed upon the earth He had fashioned. But one of the often overlooked distinctions between humans and the lower forms of life God created is the concept of “time.”    Certainly many animals have a sense of the changing seasons. And they respond according to their instilled natures by making various preparations accordingly. Some build shelters, others fly or migrate to different climes as a natural response to the passing of time and the changing seasons. But what animals lack, in comparison to humans, is the ability to appreciate time– to gauge it, to calculate it year by year, decade by decade, century by century. They do not possess the ability to truly “redeem the time” as Paul commanded of the Ephesians (cf.5:16) by using it to combat “evil” and prepare for eternity. Animals only know how to prepare for the coming season, not eternity. They have no concept of time in that way. Indeed, “eternity” is a difficult concept for us humans. When everything in our world seems to be so bound and controlled by time, we have problems comprehending a “timeless” existence.    But thankfully, we don’t have to fully grasp “eternity” to prepare for it. So how do we prepare for a timeless existence? Through the proper use of our given time, of course! Please note these points and passages in that connection:     James 4:13-14  “Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.” Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.” The point? We must understand that “time” is not guaranteed. Therefore the time we have is “now” and must be used wisely. Maybe in this sense at least, we should be more like the animals by not worrying so much about “tomorrow”- cf. Matthew 6:25-26 .     Acts 24:25-25  “But as he was discussing righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and said, “Go away for the present, and when I find time I will summon you.” We often say that we will do certain things, “When I find the time.” Time is really not “found” at all– it is appropriated. We all have the same amount of time: 24 hours every day that we continue to live. We just appropriate it differently. When we become too much like the animals, we expend all our time just living. There ceases to be a higher purpose to our existence beyond survival and carnality.     Galatians 4:4  “But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law…” There is a “fullness” of time that is determined by God. It is He who determines what the “right time” (cf. Romans 5:6) is for death, or for any other happening. We do not know what the “right time” is for our life, or lives, to end– but God does. Whether the cessation of time for each of us as individuals, or collectively at “the end of all things,” God alone has the right of determination. But we do know this: it will be neither too soon nor too late– it will be the “right time.” We must therefore be ever prepared.     Galatians 6:9  “Let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary.” We typically lose heart in our doing good when we think it isn’t “paying enough.”  The due time of reaping our rewards is not now. It is when “time” is no more. We live in an “instant gratification” world. Thus we sometimes become impatient God. We don’t understand why seemingly “bad things” to happening to us “good people.” God never promised that this life and time was either fair or rewarding. “This life” is not about “this life”- it’s about the rewards of the “next life.” So don’t lose heart in your doing of good when we feel you’re not being rewarded in a timely fashion. The time of reward is not yet “due.”     If we’ll read and understand what God tells us about “time,” we’ll be much happier and productive in our  “time upon the earth,”  and will be rewarded with a  timeless  future in heaven with God that is far beyond our present comprehension."],"title":["“Time”"],"_resultNumber":95,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/time","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":95},{"body":["It just seems like such an inflammatory thing to say. Even a fellow who already knows he is “loose with the truth” is likely to be ready to fight when and if he’s confronted with his own reality. Why is this?    Perhaps it is because “honesty” has been so generally regarded as a sure sign of a “good person.” So if someone is called out as a liar, he is necessarily also being singled out as a “bad person”- and he’s not likely to appreciate it. Possibly such is to be expected, since as Daniel Webster once put it, “Falsehoods not only disagree with truths, but usually quarrel among themselves.”    I’m not sure “honesty” is as highly regarded as it once was. In academia, it is said that “In the honor system the professors have the honor and the students have the system.” And in business, dishonesty seems to be “norm” rather than the exception. A Washington merchant inadvertently illustrated the point with a sign in his window which read: “You can fool some of the people some of the time, and, generally speaking, that’s enough to allow for profit.” While lying may be almost an expected practice in our society today, still no one likes be called a “liar.”    “Ok, so what?” Take a good, hard (and honest!) look at 1John 2:4 : “The one who says, “﻿I have come to ﻿know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a ﻿liar, and ﻿the truth is not in him…”     The Word of God, and therefore God Himself, is calling us “a liar” if we claim to be Christians and yet don’t “keep His commandments” ! Like all liars, we probably don’t like it, and we may even deny it or otherwise object and want to fight about it, but remember the admonition of Romans 3:4 , “….let God be found true, though every man be found a liar....” God is true and we are not, if we claim to be God’s children, and yet do not follow the instructions of our Father.    While we do not and cannot “earn” our salvation, because nothing we can do in service to God equates in value to what we receive from Him (and that’s called “grace”), neither will His grace be applied to those who refuse to do what He says. Notice a couple of passages in this regard: Ephesians 2:8-9 , “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not a result of works that no one should boast.” But we cannot simply stop here without considering the next verse also, which says, “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.” ( Ephesians 2:10 ) And James 2:24 adds, “You see that a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone.” The point is that if our “works” don’t match our “words,” then not only are we outside of God’s promised grace- which is the means of our salvation, He also says that we are “liars”!    We may not like it, but our dissatisfaction with God’s Word doesn’t change the truthfulness of it. After all, remember that it His grace by which we are saved, and therefore He sets the required actions that are necessary to receive it. “For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in this present age, looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior; Jesus Christ; who gave Himself up for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.” ( Titus 2:11-14 ) It is those who accept and obey the instructions of God’s grace who receive the benefits of it."],"title":["No One Likes to be Called a “Liar”!"],"_resultNumber":96,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/no_one_likes_to_be_called_a_liar","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":96},{"body":["Dr. Stephen R. Covey, famed author of and lecturer on “The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,” said, “You cannot talk yourself out of problems you behave yourself into.” (Emphasis added, PCS). While I believe Dr. Covey was entirely correct in the “bigger picture view” of personal accountability and growth, the truth of his statement sure doesn’t seem to alter the modus operandi for a lot of us! Attempting to “talk our way out of problems” is the standard operating procedure for a world of people who believe saying “I’m sorry” will fix anything and everything. This view is somewhat infantile and very naïve. Proffering an apology and/or a list of excuses meant to either justify our actions, or negate culpability for them, simply does not correct behavioral issues. What we say may mitigate some consequences of our actions in a few cases, but does nothing to correct the underlying problem. While the acknowledgment of responsibility coupled with a sincere apology is absolutely the right starting point, the real solution is changed behavior- not an endless stream of apologies and excuses.  There are a few examples that will well illustrate the principle that we cannot talk ourselves out of problems that have a behavioral cause.   Broken Promises in Relationships- We can apologize and attempt to justify or excuse ourselves all we want, but our relationships with friends, children, or even co-workers, bosses, or employees are often irreparably damaged when we fail, or repeatedly fail, to keep our word.   Broken Trust in Marriage- One of the most heart-rending questions I have been asked had to do with how to rebuild trust in a marriage once it had been broken by infidelity. Even the truly penitent, who want nothing more than to “go back” to where they were in their marriage before the offence, have to understand that trust cannot be rebuilt with mere words of promise or apology- it takes patient and consistent trustworthy actions.   Broken Fellowship with Brethren- While godly brethren are usually eager to forgive and reinstate into fellowship an erring brother or sister who sincerely confesses fault and seeks forgiveness- and rightfully so, the worthiness of that clemency is necessarily proven over time by his continued fruits (actions) of repentance.  But aside from these relational issues, the most important application of the principle that we cannot  talk  our way out of problems our  behavior  has caused concerns our salvation- our relationship with God that has been severed by sin ( cf. Isaiah 55:8-9 ). John the Baptist didn’t tell wayward Jews what to  say  to return to favor with God, he told them what they needed to  do   - “Therefore bring forth fruits in keeping with your repentance; and do not say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father,’”  Matthew 3:8-9 . On the day of Pentecost, those convicted of having killed the Messiah didn’t ask what to  say  , but what to  do  to be forgiven of their guilt of sin. They asked, “Brethren, what shall we do?” in Acts 2:37 , and were told to, “Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus for the forgiveness of your sins…” in v.38 . Saul of Tarsus, that feared persecutor of the early church, when he became aware that he was fighting against rather than for God, was not told what to say, but what to do. He had spent three days saying prayersthrough which heundoubtedly sought guidance and forgiveness, but when the Lord’s prophet Ananias came, he simply told him what he needed to  do  - “And now why do you delay? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord,”  Acts 22:16 .  None of these examples are given to minimize the importance of confessing sin, or saying, “I’m sorry for my sin”- either to others, or to God. These are certainly good and proper initial steps. But they are provided to further emphasize the point that problems or situations caused by  behavior  (in this case, “sin”) have solutions that involve more than just talk - they require action. Biblical, saving faith is not accomplished with words, but actions,  James 2:14-17 . True understanding and wisdom is not demonstrated by what we say, but what we do,  James 3:13 . And “pure and undefiled religion” is not the result of our words, but the practice of God’s Word, James 1:26-27 ! Now, are you trying to  talk  your way out of the rightful consequences of your behavior, or are you willing rebuild proper relationships with God and others by consistently and faithfully  doing  the right things?"],"title":["Talk, Talk, Talk"],"_resultNumber":97,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/talk_talk_talk","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":97},{"body":["I miss non-computerized engines and automobiles. My old diesel “Big Truck” (as it was affectionately known before I wrecked it) wouldn’t run over sixty-two miles per hour unless going down a big hill out of gear (it was in gear and only going about 40 mph when wrecked). But if you had a mind to, you could crank the window down, turn off the key, pull it from the ignition and throw it out that open window and that truck would still run that same sixty-two miles per hour because there wasn’t an “electronic” anything on it! It had no computer, and only mechanical sensors that made it easy to work on and repair- aside from the size and weight of the parts!  By contrast, now even the key you put in the ignition switch has a programmable computer chip in it, which is why they’re so big and cost so much to replace! New vehicles, big or small, now have at least one on board computer, and seemingly countless sensors for everything from O 2 (oxygen) to CPS (crankshaft position sensor) to OSS (transmission output speed sensor) and ISS (transmission input speed sensor) to etc. etc. etc.! All of this electronic gadgetry means that newer vehicles: 1) are very efficient and do amazing things automatically that we never even know happens; and 2) can be extremely hard for us old shade-tree mechanics, who don’t have computer diagnostic equipment, to repair! Those of us who knew how to use feeler gauges to set the points, and a timing light to advance or retard the ignition timing to make an engine “purr,” are just about out of luck now.  But as frustrating as all of this “electronic stuff” on current vehicles can be, it also has another advantage that older ones never had- they can diagnose themselves! That OBD (on board diagnostic [computer]) can provide a tremendous amount of information about what is going on with the various systems on the vehicle…if you have the electronic scanning computer to plug into the vehicle’s OBD to retrieve the information! Fortunately, some vehicles will flash alphanumeric codes (instead of the mileage display on Jeep/Chrysler, for instance) that provide significant information without having to attach them to an outside scanning/diagnostic computer. This is tremendously helpful, if you know how to retrieve and read the codes!  Believe it or not, all of this “mechanical” complaining and information has a spiritual point. Our modern “computerized” vehicles have incredible abilities for self-diagnosis  if  you know where to look, and how to retrieve the information. So does the soul! Several New Testament passages emphasize the importance of “self-diagnosis.” 1Corinthians 11:28 says “But let a man examine himself…”  2Corinthians 13:5 adds that we should “Test yourselves…” and Galatians 6:4 adds that “each one should examine his own work….” But like these newer vehicles, just understanding the  benefit  of self-examination or self-diagnosis is not the same thing as knowing  where to look  and  how to retrieve  and  “read”  the information! God didn’t provide us with an OBD (on board diagnostic), but He did give a “tool” that we can plug into to see what’s wrong and how to fix it. It’s called the New Testament.  Notice carefully the language of James 1:23-25 , “For if any are hearers of the word and not doers, they are like those who look at themselves in a mirror; for they look at themselves and, on going away, immediately forget what they were like. But those who look into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and persevere, being not hearers who forget but doers who act—they will be blessed in their doing.” Merely glancing or looking at the Bible from time to time is like noticing those diagnostic codes without committing them to memory or writing them down. Soon they are forgotten or ignored without making any corrections. That “Check Engine” light is on your instrument cluster for a reason, and ignoring it usually has consequences that become more costly with time. Ignoring the flashing “Check Soul” light on our spirits by not “checking the code” and making the necessary repairs/corrections has eternal consequences that far outweigh any earthly cost. On the soul, “checking the code” means we look deeply into “the mirror” of God’s Word to see ourselves as He sees us, and thus self-diagnose the problem(s). Then, we make the make the necessary repairs/corrections to be able work as He intended, and avoid the spiritual junkyard of hell!"],"title":["“Self-Diagnosis”"],"_resultNumber":98,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/self_diagnosis","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":98},{"body":["Excerpt: \"the event reminded me of a baseball player who makes the spectacular diving catch of a line drive in one inning, only to boot the routine two-hop grounder with a Sunday bounce in the next one.

He was doing OK, but was medicated and slept most of the time. We tried to keep our conversation and other noise-making to a minimum so as not to disturb him. But by mid-afternoon, boredom and lunch were conspiring to lower my eyelids. I panned the room for some distraction that would arouse my attention and senses. That’s when I spotted it- a candy, cookie, and every-other-kind-of-snack-imaginable bouquet Mollie had sent! I wasn’t at all hungry, but each tasty morsel was displayed on the end of stick in an array that far surpassed long-stemmed red roses. I plucked the cheese and cracker sticks from the spray and sat back down like a cat that had caught his first bird!  As my fairly large hands and arthritic fingers began to fumble with the wrapper- you know, the plastic one that makes enough noise to double as the bird deterrent siren at the airport, I decided that this pigeon wasn’t going to be easy to pluck! The package had apparently been hermetically molded to the stick with some type of aerospace hot glue from NASA, and the little plastic window covering the tempting morsel was evidently bullet-proof. Finally, Donna took pity on me- either that or she could no longer concentrate on the recipe she was perusing in Family Circle due to all the noise. She took it from me, and with adeptness probably best comparable to a twenty-third generation Redneck field-dressing an illegally taken deer beside the road, handed the opened package back to me in a millisecond.  That’s when it happened. Dad, though motionless and seemingly asleep, opened one eye and addressed me, “You mean you can take a motor completely apart and put it back together but you can’t open cheese and crackers?” All I could muster in reply was, “Apparently not.” As I softly snickered at his witty observation while relishing the deliciousness of my now succumbed prey, the event reminded me of a baseball player who makes the spectacular diving catch of a line drive in one inning, only to boot the routine two-hop grounder with a Sunday bounce in the next one. After further reflection, it dawned on me that many Christians suffer the same affliction: We profess and perhaps even perform great feats of faith in extreme circumstances, only to fail miserably on the daily duties of being a Christian.   When there is some “big” event or tragedy in our lives, our faith bursts forth to the surface in a brilliant display. But that same faith stays submerged, untapped, and unobserved on the day-to-day task of being a Christian. Do you think Jesus knew we would have this problem when He said, “If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily , and follow Me.” ( Luke 9:23 )? Probably. We’re kind of like Naaman in this regard- we want our association with God to be something grand and magnificent for all to see, “Behold, I thought, ‘He will surely come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place, and cure the leper.’” ( 2Kings 5:12 ) But Naaman’s servants had it right when they reasoned, “had the prophet told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more then, when he says to you, ‘Wash, and be clean’?” ( v.13 ) Naaman almost booted the routine spiritual grounder because he was expecting the laser line drive.  Sound familiar? Notice Galatians 6:5 , “For each one shall bear his own load.” The word load comes from the Greek phortion (for- tee -on). Phortion means a normal, everyday task. Here, it refers to the day-to-day obligation of being a Christian. No one else can do this for us. It is our job to be a Christian every day , and not boot the routine spiritualgrounders that any dedicated follower of Christ ought to easily handle. By contrast, v.2 reads, “Bear one another’s burdens…” Burden is translated from a word ( baros ) referring to excessive , abundant;  trouble . In this excessive or abundant trouble we should be able to depend on our brethren for help. But when it comes to being a Christian daily, that’s our job. It’s great when our faith allows us to make the difficult and perhaps spectacular “plays” of life, but let’s be sure that it also permits us to meet the routine spiritual obligations of being on God’s team daily ."],"title":["Booting the Routine"],"_resultNumber":99,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/booting_the_routine","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":99},{"body":["Preachers are often teased, most good-naturedly so, about the length of our sermons. To such jesting I typically reply with something along the lines of, “Sermonettes just make Christianettes!” (Remember, it’s usually dangerous to trade verbal barbs with a man who makes his living talking.) All of which is in good fun. But the truth about the Truth is that “the proof is in the pudding,” so to speak. Let me see if I can make sense of this apparent nonsense….  When Jesus, in Matthew 7:16 , said of false teachers, “You shall know them by their fruits,” what did He mean? Wasn’t He saying that the “product” would manifest the quality of the “plant” which produced it, as further explained in v.17 , “…every good tree bears good fruit; but the rotten tree bears bad fruit.” ? So, the principle of knowing the plant by the fruit is, in essence, the same as the “proof is in the pudding”- the overall quality is determined by the end result, either “good” or “bad.”  The apostle Paul utilized this same analogy, though not with the same words, in 1Timothy 1:3-7 . There, he lists some of the “bad fruits” which are produced by defective/diseased plants (teachers) as: occupation with myths and endless genealogies, speculation, fruitless discussions, and confident assertions made without the benefit of actual knowledge. On the other hand, the “produce” of proper plants (teachers) is: love from a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith. So, the quality of the seed and the plant can be easily discerned by looking at their progeny.  Now the big question: What does your “fruit” say about the “seed” and “plant” from which you came, spiritually speaking? Are you producing the “fruit of the Spirit” of “love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control” in your life as Paul described in Galatians 1:22-23 ? If not, the problem could well be either the “seed” or the “plant” from which you came! In Galatians 1:7 , we see that the Galatians had allowed some among them to “distort the gospel of Christ.” They had listened to a “diseased plant” which had altered “the seed.” They were, as a result, producing “bad fruit” ( cf.3:1ff; 4:9ff; 5:1ff ) from “a different gospel,”  v.6 .  If the Galatians, though initially germinated from the “good seed” of the word of God, could become diseased plants producing bad fruit, thereby “deserting Him” ( 1:6 ), and becoming “severed from Christ” and “fallen from grace” ( 5:4 ), then rest assured that the same can happen to you and me! Uncorrupted “seed” germinates and grows into spiritually healthy “plants” producing “good fruit.” But, corrupted “seed” can also germinate and grow into diseased and defective “plants” which produce “bad fruits.” Make no mistake about it, Jesus said such would be “cut down, and thrown into the fire,”  Matthew 7:19 .  These things demonstrate the unmistakable connection between good seed, good plants, good fruits, and good results- as well as the inverse. So, given the eternal importance of these things, how do you know if the “seed” is good? As we’ve already seen, you can wait sufficient time to allow for “fruit” to be borne, and judge the seed and the plant by that which they ultimately produce. Or, you can get out your Bible and read and study for yourself to see if you have been born of “good seed” (see the parable in Matthew 13:24ff ), if you are being fedand wateredby good and faithful “vine-growers” (see the parable in Matthew 21:33ff ); and if you are producing “good fruit”!

Nonetheless, I am reminded of the proverb of Solomon ( Proverbs 25:11 ) about using the “right” word in the “right” way and at the “right” time. He wrote, “Like apples of gold in settings of silver is a word spoken in right circumstances.” I’m not claiming that “circumlocution” is that “right” word, or that this is necessarily the “right” time or way to produce the effect of apples of gold in settings of silver either. But I do think “circumlocution” is a word we need to consider...  Dwight D. Eisenhower is attributed with the following quote: “An ‘intellectual’ is a man who takes more words than necessary to tell more than he knows.” We preachers, unfortunately, often fall into this category, but we are not alone. Most of us, especially when faced with a difficult situation or question, do a verbal waltz around the issue without ever really stepping on or in it. This is “circumlocution” exactly.  “Circumlocution” is the combination of two words:  circum  means round or around, as ‘ circa’ before a date means that it is around that date. Likewise, circumspect means to ‘spect,’ or look,  around; and circumstance is literally what is around your stance, or where you stand.  Locution has to do with speech. It is from the Latin word loqui , which means to speak. Hence, elocution has to do with how one speaks. Now, if we put  circum  ( around ) together with  locution  ( speech ) we get  circumlocution:  talking around an issue; usually without ever really addressing it directly.  Perhaps an example will help to illustrate. Guys, if a woman (certainly not your wife because she surely does not “fit” into this category!), asks you, “Does this outfit make me look fat?” and it does , what do you say? You probably do that earlier mentioned verbal waltz around the subject and say anything and everything you can without really ever answering the question, or you just go ahead and get the black eye!  But “circumlocution” has a more spiritual application as well. If your spiritual brother or sister is “caught in a trespass” ( Galatians 6:1a ), or “sins against you” (or someone else,  Matthew 18:15 ), do you go and talk  to  him, or just practice circumlocution by talking  around  the issue to everyone else? Or even if you do go to your brother, do you address your concerns over his soul directly, or talk  around  it to such an extent that he doesn’t even really know what you said, or why you said it? When trying to “restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness” ( Galatians 6:1b ), or win back your brother, he has to know what he’s done wrong- such is the nature of the reproof of Matthew 18:15ff . Talking around the issue without really addressing it, which is “circumlocution,” doesn’t do any good!  However, the avoidance of circumlocution doesn’t provide an excuse to be rude, unkind, or ungracious to him. Remember, you’re trying to win back your brother- not chase him off permanently! It’s easy to tell someone they’re wrong if you don’t care about them becoming right . But if you really care about their soul, and thus care about them correcting their sin, you have to be much more judicious with your words. Paul put it this way to the Colossians, “Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned, as it were, with salt, so that you may know how you should respond to each person.” ( Colossians 4:6 ). A good ‘rule of thumb/tongue’ in approaching someone about their sin is this: Speak to them the way you would want someone to tell you about your sin if/when the situation were reversed. And of course, it always helps if you’re not guilty of the same thing, or worse, yourself, Matthew 7:1-5 !"],"title":["“Circumlocution”"],"_resultNumber":101,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/circumlocution","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":101},{"body":["This past Thursday evening, Bro. Barry Pennington spoke in the final installment of the Eastside Church of Christ’s (Palestine, TX) Summer Series of lectures for this year. He told a story regarding his father, who, though departed now, was also a gospel preacher. It seems that in the sixties, when miniskirts and go-go boots were all the rage, that a young girl was about to walk into the assembly where Barry’s father was then preaching. One older man, an Elder at the congregation if I remember the story correctly, stopped the young lady and said something to the effect of, “Young lady, we don’t dress that way to worship the Lord here!” She did an abrupt about face, and never returned.    Whether or not she ever attended another Church of Christ is not known. But about the event, Brother Pennington said, “The gospel, given time, will put clothes on people.” And he was right about it. Had the Elder been patient, and the young girl been accepted and nurtured in the gospel’s teaching rather than being embarrassed and shunned, she would have learned what modesty, discretion, and appropriateness of dress was all about from the Gospel. But the Elder only saw her sin , and not her soul . Perhaps he was more concerned with the image of the congregation and his own personal preferences, than the need of this individual’s spiritual growth and development. It’s an easy trap into which to fall. I know, because I’ve “been there and done that” on this same, and other issues. Sometimes, we just fail to keep the “big picture” as clearly in focus as it needs to be, and thus become impatient, unmerciful, and intolerant of and with one another. Such makes us expect a young person, or new convert, to have the same understanding of the scriptures and life as one who has been a Christian twice as long they’ve been alive! Such is illogical at best, and can be downright divisive at worst.    Does this mean I approve clothing (in worship or out) that it is immodest, indiscreet, or inappropriate for Christians? Not at all– the Bible teaches that our clothing ought to be modest and discreet in the assembly and otherwise, 1Tim.2:9-10 and 1Pet.3:3-5 . And certainly, clothing that we wear to worship the Lord should reflect what a special and holy privilege it is to do so. It ought to manifest how “special” and “sanctified” the time we spend exalting the name of our great God is to us.    But sometimes, and unless we’re real careful, we “major in minors” by becoming so concerned with relatively incidental infractions that we cut ourselves off from opportunities to educate, encourage, and “grow” immature Christians into mature ones. In this way we tend be like the Pharisees of Jesus’ day and want to “tithe mint and dill and cummin” while neglecting the “weightier provisions of the law: justice, mercy, and faithfulness...” (see Matt.23:23ff ) If we will keep loving, keeping feeding, and keep tolerating the immature in and with the gospel, it will cause them to mature and make better decisions about their clothing– and in other areas which are much more monumental in their lives.    Do I think casual clothes such as tee-shirts and shorts are appropriate for worship or bible study? I personally don’t feel that we should be so “casual” about something as special and holy as worshiping God and studying His divine will. I think clothing that is too casual promotes attitudes and actions that are too casual in a circumstance that is supposed to be “sanctified” (set apart for a holy or religious purpose). But at the same time, this is my judgment that I have made for myself. I don’t have book, chapter, and verse authority to say that clothes which are otherwise “modest” (adequately covering the body) and “discreet” (not showy, excessive, or for the purpose of attracting specific attention) are inappropriate because they are not what I would wear, or think should be worn, to services.    We obviously do not all have the same judgment in these matters– and we likely never will as long as we have some who are, either by years in age or experience in faith, immature. And that’s OK, because if all were fully mature, it would probably mean we weren’t still growing. Having “babes in Christ” and those who are “spiritually immature” in our congregation means that we’re converting the lost and encouraging them toward spiritual growth and maturity. May it ever be so! But please be thankful for the fact that they are here, they are listening to the gospel, and that they are as a result of both of these, growing. The gospel will mature us all in the faith in these and all other matters, if we will keep at it. Until then, let’s keep pressing forward in faith, loving God, Truth, and one another- and be patiently tolerant with each other’s weaknesses and immaturities. It is, after all, what Christ expects of us. When you have a minute, please read James 2:1-13 . It doesn’t speak to being too casual or immodest , but it does talk about what should be our attitude and actions toward one another. Hope these things help. Please think about it."],"title":["“The Gospel will Clothe People”"],"_resultNumber":102,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/the_gospel_will_clothe_people","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":102},{"body":["To the suggestion of this title I can hear someone quickly reply, “What are you talking about? Of course the church is for everyone!” But it isn’t. The gospel, the “good news” of Jesus Christ, is for all ( Romans 1:16-17 ), but the church isn’t. Here’s why: the church is the  product  of those who accept the truth of the gospel through obedience. Everyone won’t do that. So while the gospel is for all, the church is not for the simple reason that “all” won’t obey the gospel. Thus, the church isn’t for them. Perhaps this is, at least in part, what is meant in John 1:12 , “But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even those who believe in His name...”   However, refusing to accept and obey the gospel is not the only reason that the church isn’t for everyone. There are other reasons also, but they also ultimately stem from the rejection of truth on some level. The church isn’t for everyone because some folks want the church to be something that it can’t be- or at least it can’t be and remain the church. This shouldn’t be surprising. Jesus was rejected as the Messiah because He wouldn’t be the physical/political king that many of the Jews wanted. He instead said, “My kingdom is not of this world.” ( John 18:36 ) So I suppose it should be only natural that some will reject His church because it isn’t what they want it to be.  If the church is to be the “pillar and ground of truth” (it is to be exactly that, 1Timothy 3:15 ), and if one doesn’t really want the truth, then naturally, the church isn’t for them. They will either reject it along with the truth which it supports, or they will seek to change the church into some more palatable and desirable entity.  Some want the church to be a social club instead of the “pillar and support of truth” ( 1Timothy 3:15 ). Jesus neither designed nor built the church for social purposes. It was designed and built for spiritual purposes, and to be the Lord’s church, it must be maintained the same way. While members of the church certainly enjoy studying the Bible together, worshipping God together, and commemorating the Lord’s death together, it is the pursuit of these spiritual purposes which bring them together- not the desire of social interaction. There are many clubs and organizations which can provide for social needs and desires of man; the Lord’s church is to provide for his spiritual needs and desires.  Some want the church to be an entertainment center. Jesus did not die on the cross to provide an organization to meet man’s recreational needs and desires. Please listen to 1Peter 4:6 on this point, “For the gospel has for this purpose been preached to those who are dead (meaning spiritually dead, though physically alive- PCS) , that though they are judged in the flesh as men, they may live in the spirit according to the will of God.” The purpose of which this passage speaks is not man’s recreation or entertainment, but the salvation of his soul from eternal destruction. This is the purpose of the church, not to entertain or recreate. If entertainment and recreation is what one wants, the Lord’s church is not for them.  Some want the church to be an educational facility or day-care for their children. While there is certainly nothing wrong with wanting the best education and care for your children that you can get, does such really fit into the church’s purpose of being “the pillar and support of truth”?  Romans 1:23ff speaks of those who would remake God into their own image. It seems that some folks of our day want to do the same with God’s church: they want to remake it to suit their own needs and purposes, rather than those of God. God didn’t establish the church to provide our children a safe and wholesome place to play while we’re at work; nor did He create it to educate our children in the wisdom of man. God built and established the church to be “the pillar and support of truth” - to preach and teach the gospel to the salvation of souls. If it is daycare and education that one wants, the Lord’s church is not for them.  What I hope we see from all of this is actually quite simple. The Lord’s church was designed for one purpose: to be that which supports, upholds, and demonstrates the truth of the gospel. As such, it is an organization comprised of those who accept and obey the gospel. If one doesn’t want to obey, support, uphold, and demonstrate the gospel through righteous living, then the church isn’t for them. Of course, the inverse is also true!","Yes, I agree. The Church is a place of god. And it is a holy place for us. The people who are not believe on God, for those the Church is not made.

Such just seems to “go with the job” in both cases. Any preacher who doesn’t understand and accept this, or who has a thin skin, won’t last very long. For instance, did you hear the one about the embarrassed wife who tried to explain to the minister why her husband walked out during the sermon? “It wasn’t that he didn’t agree with what you were saying,” she said sheepishly, “He just sleep walks.” Fortunately, most preachers have a pretty good sense of humor and thus take the kidding well.  But when God spoke of “the foolishness of the message preached” ( 1Corinthians 1:21ff ), He was speaking of man’s estimation of “preaching” God’s Word in comparison to man’s view of his own self-proclaimed wisdom. God was not saying preaching was “foolish” Himself, but that man viewed it that way. In what man therefore viewed as “foolish,” God chose to invest the very power of salvation. “For the word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to those who are being saved it is the power of God.” ( 1Corinthians 1:18 ) Preachers who are worth anything understand this very well, and would be still “preaching the word in season and out of season” whether they spoke to an audience of two or two-hundred, and whether they were getting paid to do so or not!  Sure, there are preachers who preach for wrong reasons. Paul warned Timothy of them, “For some men…have turned aside to fruitless discussion, wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions.” ( 1Timothy 1:6-7 ) He also wrote that some preach “from envy and strife” and “selfish ambition” ( Philippians 1:15,17 ). Preaching that is done to advance or benefit “self” is not only wrongly motivated, it will be corrupted to be popular and acceptable to the masses. It will be designed and delivered in such a way as to make salvation “cheap” ( cp. Luke 14:26-35 ), and people to feel comfortable in their sin. It will make salvation a “quick and easy” proposition that is a “one time for all time” deal rather than a lifetime commitment of faithful obedience to God. It will also “accept people as they are” instead of endeavoring to make them “partakers of the divine nature” ( 2Peter 1:4 ). Paul warned of these things too, “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accord with their own desires; and will turn aside from the truth…”   Herein lays the real danger of preaching that is selfishly motivated: not only does it destroy the faithfulness of the messenger, but because of the corruption of the message, it is impotent to affect salvation in its hearers. The gospel is “the power of God for salvation” ( Romans 1:16 ) only when it is preached in purity of content and motivation. Notice again Paul’s inspired words to Timothy on this point, “But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.” ( 1Timothy 1:5 ) So, do you want the “whole truth and nothing but the truth” in your preaching, or do you just want to be made to feel good and comfortable in a sinful condition?"],"title":["The “Foolish” Power of Preaching"],"_resultNumber":104,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/the_foolish_power_of_preaching","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":104},{"body":["This is not an article on the relative advantages and liabilities of public vs. private (home) education. Each has its benefits, and each has its costs. Some send their children to public school because they don’t have the time, inclination, or ability to educate them themselves. Others start with grandiose or even noble ideas about “home-schooling” their children only to become less than diligent regarding the matter, and wind up doing a poor job of providing them with an education. Simply put, there are failures and successes on both sides of the comparison ledger. Obviously and ultimately, parents must take all the factors into consideration, and try to decide and do what they feel is best for their children. But again, this is really not the point of our title question.  As fathers, Ephesians 6:4 lays the responsibility to raise our children “in the discipline and instruction of the Lord” upon us. Such isn’t a requirement that is particular to the New Testament. As a part of the Law of Moses, Deuteronomy 6:1-9 , required extensive “home-schooling” of their children pertaining to the will of God of every Hebrew father. The fact there weren’t many other options for educating children in the ways of God at the time doesn’t at all diminish the point. Note some specific instructions given them in this regard:  · Love the Lord your God with all  your heart  and all  your soul  and all  your might  , v.5 . Before any father can begin to “home school” his children about the Lord and things spiritual, he must first invest his whole being in loving God himself.  · The  words  of God’s commandment must likewise be on his heart, v.6 . It is not enough to simply feel the right way about God, the “home schooling” father must also know what Jehovah commands. Remember, this is about education- and such requires that specific knowledge of the Lord, His ways, and His requirements be known before it can be taught. One cannot teach what he does not first know.  · Then, with these prerequisites in place, the “home schooling” father can begin  diligently teaching  these things when he sits in the house, when he walks by the way, and when he lies down and rises up,  v.7  . This process of educating is not something that is accomplished by reading a bedtime story from the Bible to a toddler, but is an on-going part of every facet of life and its experiences. It is both a constant and continual effort of raising the child that undergirds every aspect of the father’s association with him.  · The commands of God must be bound as a sign on the father’s hand, and as frontals of his forehead, v.8 . This probably refers to the Jewish practice of placing portions of Scripture in small pouches that were tied to the wrist (presumably to help steer or direct the hand to do God’s will), or around the head as a band with the pouch resting upon the temple (to help steer or direct the mind). The idea here is that God’s word is both to control the father’s own thoughts and actions, as well as being an example or sign for the child. “Do as I say, not as I do” has never worked- and never will because children learn as much (if not more) from what their father does as what he says.  · Finally, the Word of God should be written on the doorposts of the house, and on its gates , v.9 . Thus, the first thing the child sees either coming or going from the house is the Law of God. This continual reminder serves as reinforcement to what the father has loved, demonstrated, and taught. But it must also be understood that simply plastering biblical passages and platitudes in and around the house does little good if the father has not first loved and demonstrated them in an exemplary way.  While Bible Classes at the local congregation level can be tremendous assets, and ought to be utilized by godly parents to the fullest extent possible toward the spiritual education of their children, such can never replace the “home school” of a father taking his responsibility seriously to be the spiritual head of his family ( cf. Ephesians 5:23ff ) and raise his children “in the discipline and instruction of the Lord” ( Ephesians 6:4 ). Let’s face it fathers, God didn’t ordain local congregation bible classes to provide the spiritual education for your children, He ordained you to do it! Take that responsibility seriously, or you will likely raise spiritual illiterates instead of strong Christians who will become your spiritual legacy."],"title":["Are Your Children (biblically/spiritually) Home-Schooled?"],"_resultNumber":105,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/are_your_children_biblically_spiritually_home_schooled","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":105},{"body":["I’m not big on “series” articles because it’s difficult to string them together in a cohesive way. Nonetheless, I do want to follow up on a point or two that were mentioned in last week’s edition. We previously tried to get the point across that the first step to “raising godly and dedicated children” was to be a godly and dedicated parent- fathers in particular are given this responsibility in Ephesians 6:4 . But as with most things in life, example alone is usually not enough. Jesus didn’t just live a godly life, He taught by proclamation also. He didn’t just do the right things Himself and hope that others would follow his example- He educated and encouraged people to do the right things also. It’s the same with raising godly children.  First, let’s consider the matter of “educating” your children spiritually. This means teaching them about God, His Word, and His Church. As was intimated last week, you cannot teach what you do not know. And, if you try to teach what you do not value and practice yourself, you will fail. While we are not under the Law of Moses today (the Old Testament, cf. Romans 7:1-4 ), there are many lessons from it which can be very helpful in understanding God, and what He expects of His people. Take, for instance, Deuteronomy 6 on the importance and methods of teaching your children to respect and obey God. In the first six verses of this chapter, God emphasizes being wholly committed to Him in both heart (love) and life (obedience). But notice carefully what follows in vv.7-9 , “and you shall teach them  ( i.e. the words of God)  diligently   to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down  and when you rise up . And you shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead . And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates .” Get the picture? Raising godly children includes, but takes more than just the right example of vv.1-6 . It also requires diligent, persistent, and constant education. But example and education aren’t all there is to the matter either. Encouragement is also important.  I am amazed when people think and say such things as, “I don’t want to force God (or the Bible, religion, or religious conviction) on my children; I want them to make up their own minds about such things.” It’s funny how these same people don’t mind “forcing” tooth-brushing, bathing, healthy eating habits and trips to the doctor or the dentist on their children when these things have only to do with the  physical  aspects of this life. But when it comes to the  spiritual  aspects of the child’s eternal well-being, they all of a sudden now become entirely passive. “Oh consistency, thou art a jewel!”  Recently, a friend of mine spoke about being taken to church services when he was a child. He said he had two choices: 1) he could go to church  with a whipping  ; or 2) he could go to church  without  a whipping  - the choice was his, but either way, he was going! Why? His parents understood their responsibilities, and also knew that he wasn’t yet mature enough to make such decisions “for himself”- just like he wasn’t mature enough to decide whether or not to bathe, brush his teeth, or have chocolate cake for supper! By the way, my friend has been a very faithful and capable gospel preacher for many years now. The point of which is this: We have to  encourage  our children toward godliness in the same ways we encourage them toward other healthy habits. They may resist in the same way that most kids resist good hygiene and other healthy habits at first, but it is best for them in the long run.  Remember the keys to raising godly children:  Example, Education,  and  Encouragement.  While these will not eliminate the free moral agency of your children- they may still chose ungodliness over godliness, this at least points them in the right direction."],"title":["Raising Godly Children- Example Alone is Not Enough"],"_resultNumber":106,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/raising_godly_children_example_alone_is_not_enough","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":106},{"body":["Before you think I’ve finally flipped my lid completely, and realizing that I am far too old with knees that have had way too much sports in the past to sit cross-legged on the floor chanting anything, such is not the kind of meditation to which the title refers. Instead, the “meditation” to which I refer is simply concentrated contemplation . It doesn’t require special clothes or postures, or humming or chanting anything- but it might require practice.  Our day-to-day lives are so filled with information and entertainment that real concentrated contemplation is difficult. Oh, I know we can focus intently on a task at hand on the job, or we can even become totally engrossed with some recreational hobby or video game, but can we just sit quietly and think? Are we able to focus our attention completely on conscious contemplation for more than a few minutes? Are we able to keep our minds fixated on a particular topic of thought for an extended period- like half an hour? Or, has the constantly changing images of television led us into a short attention span epidemic? Don’t get ahead of me here. This is not an anti-television rant. I actually watch a good deal of television, and there are still worthwhile programs available. For example, a large portion of my television viewing time is devoted to watching baseball. But, have you ever noticed how many different camera switches (from differing angles) occur in the twenty or so seconds between pitches? It’s amazing to contemplate…. if you can still concentrate long enough to do so!  All of which got me to thinking about how our subconscious training toward short attention span has affected our spiritual growth and development. For me, I noticed that a few areas seemed to be the most affected. So, focus your attention as best you can, and “meditate” on them with me for a few minutes to see if you have the same challenges. After all, identifying the problem is part of the solution.   It’s hard for me to concentrate my contemplations in   prayer . My mind wanders, especially in private prayer. First, I don’t dedicate the right, or enough, time for it. I try to squeeze it in before I drift off to sleep, or before answering the next email, or even worse, before the commercial break ends! The Savior dedicated time to be in prayerful communion with His Father. He went off somewhere alone and spent hours, if not all night, pouring His heart out in divine communication. Perhaps if we would devote sufficient and appropriate time to prayer, our prayerful meditations would be better and more productive- and we’d get better at it! “Devote yourselves to prayer….”  Colossians 4:2 .   It’s hard for me to concentrate my contemplations in worship.  It is far too easy to be thinking about my sermon introduction, or adding some pertinent passage to a point in it, while we are singing praises to God. Then, my mouth sings the mostly right words- and even does so “on pitch” occasionally, and my mind is concentrating, but on the wrong thing! Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are supposed to be sung first and foremost from the heart,  Ephesians 5:19 ; Colossians 3:16 . But if I’m thinking about my sermon, or what’s for lunch, there is no true praise being given to God, there is no uplift to my spirit through singing, and there is little encouragement being given to my brethren. If such is true during the song service, how much more are the detrimental effects of this lack of concentration manifested during the memorial of Christ’s body and blood?   It’s hard for me to concentrate my contemplations on spiritual matters generally as much as I could and should. It is so easy, in our technology-based world, to have constant inputs from television, radio, computers, laptops, iPods, iPads, and iWhatever-is-the-latest techno gadget, that true quiet time alone is lost. We can fill our every waking moment with news, entertainment, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to the extent that we are never really alone and quiet. These things necessarily occupy our minds, and can effectively eliminate the possibility of meditating on spiritual matters. So, when you’re driving or mowing or doing whatever puts you alone and not having to be fully mentally occupied, try turning off the gadgets and spend some quality time concentrating your contemplations on godly things. You’ll be amazed how you’ll think of biblical passages or books you want to read ( Acts 17:11 ), or realize the spiritual needs of others that you might help ( Hebrews 10:24 ), or even discover great spiritual topics that are worthy of your meditation ( Philippians 4:8 ). Give yourself some time to tune out the world, and just be still and meditate on spiritual things.

As previously mentioned, I really don’t like doing “series” pieces in this format because it is difficult to maintain cohesion without a lot of repetition. Nonetheless, there was one more major aspect with which I felt compelled to deal. But this will be the last installment on this matter for now. However, I do plan to present a series of lessons on this topic very soon during our Sunday morning services which will be much more detailed than what we’ve covered here. So, what is the biggest mistake parents make when trying to raise (godly) children?  In my opinion, and I’ve already told you I’m not a certified counselor or psychologist- just a preacher trying understand and teach what God gives us, the biggest mistake parents commit in raising children is making them the center, or central focal point, of the family. I know- when we become parents it changes our world forever. These blessed babies instantly capture our hearts because they emanate from us, and are completely dependent upon us. Such is natural and right- at least at first. But as children begin to grow and develop, our job becomes more than just meeting their physical needs. Children have emotional needs too. Soon it becomes apparent that we must learn to distinguish their  needs  from their  wants   . This is true physically and emotionally. A child that has become the focal point of the family will soon dominate every aspect of it with not just their needs, but their wants.  Think of the problem this way: Which came first- the “family” or the “child”? While it is unfortunately true that many “families” are formed because of a pregnancy, God’s order that a husband and a wife make a baby- not the other way around, Hebrews 13:4; Titus 2:4-5 . If we get this backwards, we’ve started out wrong. While this situation is not insurmountable, diligence must be given to get back to God’s way of doing things. The point is that the husband/wife relationship created , and must sustain , the parent/child relationship, not the inverse. Many parents have difficulty learning to properly raise their children because they did not learn to be husbands and wives first.  But let’s get back to the “needs” vs. “wants” matter as it relates to both physical and emotional issues. Children who are made the focal point of the family with regard to both their needs and wants, whether physical or emotional, soon become addicted to attention because they’ve become accustomed to being overdosed with it. To illustrate, please read the next paragraph carefully.  “Children need  food  . But they don’t need a lot of it. If you persist in giving a child more  food  than he or she needs, that child will become dependent upon continuing to receive excessive amounts of  food  . If you continue to feed that dependency, it will grow into an obsession that will function as a powerful, driving force in that child’s life. The child’s sense of well being will lean increasingly on the notion that in order to feel secure, he/she must have constant access to  food  . Eventually, the child will become a  food  addict, and the condition will hang like a stone around the child’s neck, encumbering the growth of self-esteem.”  Now consider that same paragraph again, but this time we'll substitute the word “ attention ” for the word “ food .”   “Children need  attention  . But they don’t need a lot of it. If you persist in giving a child more  attention  than he or she needs, that child will become dependent upon continuing to receive excessive amounts of  attention  . If you continue to feed that dependency, it will grow into an obsession that will function as a powerful, driving force in that child’s life. The child’s sense of well being will lean increasingly on the notion that in order to feel secure, he/she must have constant access to  attention  . Eventually, the child will become a  attention  addict, and the condition will hang like a stone around the child’s neck, encumbering the growth of self-esteem.”  Get the picture? We can easily overdose our children on “attention” by repeatedly giving in to their “wants” ( Proverbs 30:15-17 ). Such is ultimately detrimental to the child. Do children have both physical and emotional needs that we as loving parents must meet? Absolutely! But can they be encouraged to be selfish and manipulative by well-meaning parents making them and their “wants” the focal point of the family? Absolutely! Children are by definition, immature. They are thus incapable of dictating what is proper and best for the family as a whole. That’s the parents’ job. Don’t surrender control of the family to the children’s “wants” or “needs.” There was a family before the children came along, and hopefully, there will be one after they’re moved out. The husband and wife relationship must be made the central focal point of the family for it to succeed. After all, they’re the ones who created, and must maintain the family. Keep things in the right order according to God’s Word, and things always work out better."],"title":["Raising Godly Children- The Biggest Mistake We Parents Make"],"_resultNumber":108,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/raising_godly_children_the_biggest_mistake_we_parents_make","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":108},{"body":["Satan is shown in scripture to be as “sneaky” as a snake ( Genesis 3 ), and as ferocious as a lion ( 1Peter 5:8 ). But it seems to me that his subtlety is more dangerous than his ferocity- after all, most would head in the opposite direction fast if they heard a lion roar! Surely some would react the same upon seeing a snake, but Eve didn’t, did she? She was instead intrigued by his reasoning and logic, no matter how illogical and contradictory to God’s words it was. Such seems to be Satan’s greatest weapon: his ability to use lies and craftiness to get people to believe things that directly and blatantly contradict God’s word....  I know of no greater example of Satan’s ability to get people to believe notions that plainly contradict God than the oft-quoted mantra, “It doesn’t really matter what you believe about God/Bible, as long as you’re honest and sincere- after all, we’re all just taking different roads to the same place.” I just have to say it- that is the biggest load of ‘poop’ Satan ever peddled! And I dare say it will cause more souls to be gained by the Serpent of Old than anything else he has ever said or done! Consider how ludicrous such a notion really is, please.  First, if “it doesn’t really matter what you believe,” then why did God go to all the trouble of giving us the inspired revelation and commanding us to read, study, and obey it? But He did just that. Please note these quotations from God’s word, “that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. And by referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight to the mystery of Christ…to be specific, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,” ( Ephesians 3:3,4,6 ); “So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” ( Romans 10:17 ); “Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, handling accurately the word of truth.” ( 2Timothy 2:15 ); “All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.” ( 2Timothy 3:16-17 ) Friends, these passages make absolutely no sense whatsoever if, as some say, “it doesn’t really matter what you believe.” Of course it matters what you believe, what you practice, and what you teach!  Second, there is the “honest and sincere” part. Common sense must surely prevail here. Can a man be “honesty and sincerely” wrong? Sure he can. If he gets out on Highway 69 and heads south “honestly and sincerely” believing it will take him to Dallas, will it? Of course not! Poor old Jacob “honestly and sincerely” believed (for 22 years) that his son Joseph was dead- so much so that he “refused to be comforted” in his grief. Did Jacob’s honest and sincere belief that Joseph was dead make it so? Of course not! Joseph was alive and well and the second in command of Egypt, cf. Genesis 37:31-36; 42:36; 45:26-28 . Likewise, if we are “dead wrong” about what God says it takes to be pleasing and acceptable to Him, it won’t matter how honestly and sincerely we believed whatever lie Satan told us. Isn’t that the lesson from Eve’s interaction with the Serpent? She and her husband were rejected from fellowship with God because she believed a lie- however honestly and sincerely she believed it!  Third, remember the Bible is given by God as a roadmap to heaven. We can get “honestly and sincerely” lost if we don’t follow its directions correctly, cf. Titus 2:11-15 ! Jesus often indicated there was but “one way” to get to heaven. Please carefully consider His words, “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven.” ( Matthew 7:21 ); and “I have come as light into the world, that everyone who believes in Me may not remain in darkness. And if anyone hears My sayings, and does not keep them, I do not judge him….the word I spoke is what will judge him at the last day.” ( John 12:46-48 ). The “one way” is knowing and doing what Jesus says. This surely means that there are a lot of “wrong roads” out there, despite the honesty and sincerity of their travelers.  Friends, read your Bible. Know your Bible. Obey your Bible. And don’t listen to Satan or his emissaries who tell you “it doesn’t really matter what you believe, as long as you are honest and sincere.” It does matter. In fact, it matters for all of eternity."],"title":["Satan’s Greatest Weapon"],"_resultNumber":109,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/satans_greates_weapon","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":109},{"body":["When the boys were still “little,” Donna and I bought some big and complicated toy for them- I don’t even recall what it was. But I do remember that it had about twelve pages of instructions detailing how to assemble this monstrosity. These instructions were printed in eight or nine languages, none of which was English! Now I know a little Greek and even less Hebrew from my bible studies, but neither of these languages was discernable from the weird characters and squiggly marks all over that wad of crumpled papers. So, I did what every self-respecting, red-blooded, macho-man does: I threw the instructions away, looked at the picture on the box, and assembled the thing the way I thought it should go. And when I got finished, there were only a couple of unused pieces left, it worked, and no one died playing with it!  However, this little story is not typical of “instructions”- usually you have to follow them to receive the benefit desired.  For instance, if some friend of yours gives you instructions to get to his house, you have to follow them if you want to get there. If you decide you want to turn left where he said to turn right, you’re never going to make it. Such sounds simple enough to be axiomatic.  But how often we fail to apply the same reasonable logic to God’s instructions! We want to “come to God in my own way ,” or “worship God in my own way ,” or “serve God in my own way ” instead of the way He instructed us. That makes about as much sense as turning left when the instructions said to turn right. I suppose the problem is that of failing to view God’s Word as “instruction”- but that is exactly what it is! Note a couple of passages in this connection.   “Grace and peace be multiplied to you the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord; seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence.” ( 2Peter 1:2-3 ) This doesn’t mean that God’s Word tells you what make or color of car to buy. But it does mean that He has given us the “instructions” for traveling the road of life leading to heaven- if we will just read and follow them!   “For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in this present age…” ( Titus 2:11-12 ) This passage makes it clear that the “grace of God” which brings salvation is in the form of “instructions.” So, to receive God’s grace in salvation, His “instructions” must be followed.  All of which sounds simple enough. The “road” of life which leads to heaven must be traveled according to the instructions God gave us in His Word, the Bible. Jesus said it wasn’t the easiest path, or the one most widely used, Matthew 7:13-14 . Therefore we can’t go “our own way” and expect to reach the intended destination. Likewise, when we find we’ve taken a “wrong turn” in life (consider the Prodigal Son in Luke 15:11-24 ), we have do a U-turn called “repentance” and get back to traveling the right road, Revelation 2:5 . Instructions are only beneficial when followed. So don’t “throw away” or otherwise disregard God’s instructions- you can’t put life together properly, or get to heaven without them!"],"title":["It’s a Funny Thing about Instructions"],"_resultNumber":110,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/its_a_funny_thing_about_instructions","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":110},{"body":["The birth of a child is a blessed event. It brings such joy and happiness- and responsibility. As parents, perhaps for the first time in our lives, we learn what it means to give unconditional love. Probably also for the first time in our lives, we feel the awesome responsibility of what it means to have someone else be completely and totally dependent upon us. This tremendous onus causes some parents to become obsessively compulsive about matters of nutrition, cleanliness, health, and general care of the child. The doctors are barraged with phone calls, visits, and questions about every tendency and trait of the child- whether real or imagined. Constant comparisons are made to other children with regard to growth-chart percentiles, and other developmental abilities. In short, anything and everything is tried or done that could possibly provide any advantage for growth and development for this new “bundle of joy!” But let’s think about some of these things in a spiritual connotation.  Being “born again” ( cf. John 3:3,5 ) on the basis of faith and through the waters of baptism is the process by which one becomes a “new creature” ( 2Corinthians 5:17 ), or “newborn babe” ( 1Peter 2:2 ), in Christ. In many ways, spiritual growth and development parallels its physical counterpart. Spiritual growth requires attention to nutrition, cf. 1Peter 2:1-2 ; rest, Philippians 4:6-7 ; cleanliness, 2Peter 2:20 ; and exercise, 2Peter 1:5-8 . These things are a lesson unto themselves, but are not here the direct focus of our attention.  What happens when a physical child doesn’t grow, develop, and mature according the normal order? There is immediate concern, investigation as to the preventative cause, and corrective and additional assistive steps are implemented. But what happens when a  spiritual babe in Christ does not grow, develop, and mature? Is there a parallel level of concern, investigation, and assistance given? Sadly, such is usually not the case. Spiritual family members (fellow church members), parents (those who taught and brought them forth by the gospel), and grandparents (church leaders) are typically not nearly as concerned about growth, development, and maturity as physical parents, despite the eternal consequences which are implied by the deficiency. Thus, “Maybe he will grow eventually” becomes the sad response to the situation. Why does this lamentable circumstance exist?  Perhaps there is one overlooked or unrealized key truth to these matters: We fail to recognize that one cannot continue to live in a state of perpetual infancy. As a physical child that, for whatever reason, fails to grow will die, so too will a spiritual child that fails to develop beyond infancy perish. One just cannot remain a babe, or child, perpetually- physically or spiritually! How we fail to grasp this point in the spiritual realm while so clearly comprehending it in the physical one is unfathomable. Doesn’t the Parable of the Sower clearly teach this lesson in Matthew 13:21 ? The young plant that sprouted in the rocky soil had “no firm root in himself, but is only temporary , and when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he falls away .” Having “no firm root” is surely an indication of a lack of growth and development that seals its fate. But please remember, this part of the parable is not about dying “plants”- but dying Christians who fail to grow and mature!  Let’s extrapolate these things to one more point: Churches composed of perpetual spiritual infants will suffer the same tragic fate as its individual members. Why is this so? It is the spiritually mature who reproduce! Spiritual infants are not sufficiently developed, obviously, to reproduce. Thus, churches will not, and in fact, cannot, survive in a state of perpetual infancy. A congregation that does not grow, develop, mature, and reproduce will die.  I fear that we, generally speaking, have become all too comfortable with the notion of perpetual spiritual infancy. If so, whether sooner or later, spiritual death is inevitable. The good news is, however, that it doesn’t have to be this way- we can, and must  think and do better! So, let’s take seriously the task of raising and rearing babes in Christ to spiritual maturity for their ultimate good, and the long-term good of the Cause of Christ!"],"title":["Perpetual Infancy"],"_resultNumber":111,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/perpetual_infancy","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":111},{"body":["Many years ago and where we lived at the time, there was a movement within the school system toward what was termed “outcome based education.” As I understood it then, and please pardon what I’m sure is a vast over-simplification, the idea was that “education” was best accomplished when the “right” answer was achieved, regardless of how it was achieved. Certainly the notion did not allow or excuse cheating, but instead encouraged “free thinking” over formulas, and “creativeness” over the memorization of tried and true methods. In short, as long as you got the right answer eventually, it really didn’t matter how you did so, or how many times you got the wrong answer first (and by the way, there really weren’t any “wrong” answers, just ones that weren’t “as correct”). Having long-time educators in both mine and Donna’s family, this just didn’t seem right to me. I had always thought that it did matter how you got there, and that “getting there” with the least amount of mistakes was important too. This article isn’t about the school system, or the debatable value of current or past methodology. But it dawns on me now that many people approach religion, or more specifically, Christianity, with the same type of outcome-based reasoning.    They evaluate and determine what to do or not do based on what they perceive the outcome will be. Such doesn’t sound too bad on the surface. There even seem to be some passages which support the idea. Note for instance, 1Timothy 1:3-5 : “As I urged you upon my departure for Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines, nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to mere speculation rather than furthering the administration of God which is by faith. But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.” Paul seems to be saying that the “value” of the teaching can be determined by what it produces– either fruitless discussions and speculations, or love, a good conscience, and sincere faith. Indeed, Jesus likewise emphasized at least part of this principle when He said, “You will know them by their fruits.” ( Matthew 7:16 ) But is this really the same as determining what we will or won’t do religiously by what we think the “outcome” might be? I don’t think so. Please consider the following.    Noah preached to his generation to warn them against the coming flood of destruction. If “outcome-based” thinking had been involved, he likely would have never made the effort– after all, only eight out of an estimated three billion in the world at that time listened. But wasn’t it the “right” thing for Noah to do anyway?    Conversely, Jonah did not want to go and preach to Nineveh because he feared the “outcome.” He even stated in Jonah 4:2 that he knew God would save the Ninevites if they repented, and he wanted them killed. He tried to forestall God’s plan to save them by fleeing in the opposite direction. But God made him go preach anyway, because it was the “right” thing to do– regardless of the outcome, cf. Jonah 4:11 .    But “outcome-based” notions don’t just affect decisions regarding preaching or not preaching. We make decisions every day as Christians that affect not only ourselves, but others. If we decide to act or not act because of what we think the outcome may be, are we not putting ourselves in God’s place? He instructs us regarding “right” things to do– regardless of what “outcome” we either fear they may have, or that they do in reality have, and we must do them because He says they’re “right”! Hopefully one passage will suffice to drive this point home. Consider 1Peter 2:18-20 , “Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable. For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly. For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God.” There are times when doing the “right” thing, as determined by God, has immediate detrimental effects on us personally. But it is still the “right” thing to do regardless of the short-term consequence, or outcome.    We must determine our activities by what God says is “right”- not by the outcome produced by our actions whether they are real or imagined."],"title":["“Out-Come Based” Religion"],"_resultNumber":112,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/out-come_based_religion","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":112},{"body":["Several forms we’re required to fill out these days require “Emergency Contact” information- someone to call if something happens to you. A first cousin, an only child, recently moved back to East Texas to help care for her mother. Her mother is still very independent and capable at 88 years (or thereabouts), but obviously will need some help eventually. This cousin had to fill out a form that asked for an “Emergency Contact.” She has a daughter back in Arizona, but that was deemed unacceptable due to the distance involved. And an 88 year old mother, well, let’s just say that wasn’t the best option either. So, Cousin called my sister and asked if she would be her “Emergency Contact” person- which was a great choice. But it got me to thinking about “Emergency Contacts.” What a blessing family and “church family” can be to us as “Emergency Contacts!”  Years ago, when I was hospitalized and diagnosed with Stage 4 T-Cell Lymphoma, there were immediate (and much appreciated!) responses from both my physical and spiritual families . Some of both branches took turns staying with me at the hospital, and our two relatively young sons instantly had places to stay for “as long as necessary” with members of our spiritual family. All of their needs, including school, were handled as just a matter of course. What a relief these “Emergency Contacts” were to Donna and me! She was free to do everything she could to take care of me, and did she ever! It’s hard to imagine how people without supports like these make it through life.  But there are people who are somewhat alone in the world. Without physical family- or at least any on whom they can depend in times of trouble or need, if they haven’t developed a spiritual (church) family, to whom do they turn as their “Emergency Contact”? We may not have any control over our “physical family” circumstance(s). However, if we are without a “spiritual family,” it is all our fault! These “spiritual relations” are all up to us. If we haven’t established and maintained them through mutual association and dependence in church fellowship, we have no one to blame but ourselves.  While “church families” primarily serve to spiritually edify and encourage us, there is no doubt that they also provide physical supports. Please note the following excerpts from Romans 12:9-16 which detail some of the benefits of having a spiritual family, “Let love be without hypocrisy…Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to one another in honor; not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord; rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulations, devoted to prayer, contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality…Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep. Be of the same mind toward one another…” What “Emergency Contacts” spiritual families make!  However, we must also realize that to have this kind of help at the ready in times of need, we must be known and recognized as part of the family. We accomplish this through constancy and devotion- both to the Lord and His people. If the only time we contact our spiritual family is when we have some emergency, or need or want something, we may well find that they really do not consider us part of the “family” at all. And who could blame them? No physical or spiritual family tolerates those who only “take” and never “give” for very long.  Spiritual families are intended and given by God to be our “Emergency Contacts” for all they can provide- spiritually and physically. Obviously, He takes care of the rest Himself. Our church family should be the (spiritual) friend who sticks closer than a (physical) brother , Proverbs 18:24 . But if you never become part of that spiritual family, or don’t maintain and sustain that relationship, who else will you have to put down as your “Emergency Contact”?"],"title":["Emergency Contacts"],"_resultNumber":113,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/emergency_contacts","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":113},{"body":["The words of mere men, though uninspired, may cause us to be awakened to the truth and meaning of those words which are divinely inspired. Men of mental prowess, who have great commitment to study biblical Truth, can help bring us to better understanding of what God would have us to be. The Hebrews writer seems to speak to this very point in Heb.6:12-13 , “And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end, that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.” Similarly, the Apostle Paul often encouraged brethren to hold in high regard those who labored for, and led them, cf. Phil.2:29 ; 1Cor.16:18 ; 1Thess.5:12-13 .    However, not all men of understanding are equally adept at applying scripture to their own lives. Solomon was the declared to be the wisest man of his generation, and yet oft failed to adequately apply his wisdom to the obedience of God’s Word. Indeed, in this way we all likely fall short. Which of us does not know more of divine Truth than we live? Still yet, there is much that can be learned from those who “receive the word with great eagerness, examining the scriptures daily, to see whether these things were so.” (Acts 17:11, of the Bereans)    With these few thoughts in mind, please consider carefully the quote below. It was the prayer of John Baillie, a Scottish theologian and professor at the famed Edinburgh University. There he sought to influence young men’s minds toward awareness of the omnipresence of God in their lives. Mr. Baillie also wrote A Dairy of Private Prayer (1936) which came to be regarded as a devotional classic. But some have suggested that his most important contribution to theology in general was his exploration in teaching, writing, and lecturing on the relationship between the knowledge of God to man’s spiritual and moral experience– that is, and surely over-simplified, doing what we know to be right. I think you’ll see evidence of that conviction in his words:    “Teach me, O God, to use all the circumstances of my life today that they may bring forth in me the fruits of holiness rather than the fruits of sin. Let me use disappointment as material for patience: Let me use success as material for thankfulness: Let me use suspense as material for perseverance: Let me use danger as material for courage: Let me use reproach as material for longsuffering: Let me use praise as material for humility: Let me use pleasures as material for temperance: Let me use pains as material for endurance.”    What a wonderful petition! That in all of life’s circumstances, whatever they may be– whether pleasant or tragic, we allow the Lord of the Universe to use them teach us to be godly. Life is to be a journey of learning, but not learning for mere knowledge’s sake. Learning is useless without application in one’s life. In the sense of divine knowledge which is not applied, it’s sinful– James 4:17, “Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do, and does not do it, to him it is sin.”    When our minds and hearts are filled with the knowledge of divine text, we can then interpret all of life’s situations and circumstances through that prism of understanding, so that we act and react according God’s will for us. Thus, when we, armed with the knowledge of God’s word, meet the circumstances of daily life, we understand them to be opportunities to grow in wisdom through living godly. Such is the essence of having the “senses trained to discern good and evil” of which Heb.5.14 is speaking.    So, how are you doing? Life “got you down?” Not if your mind is filled with the knowledge of God’s word, your heart is filled with the desire to “learn what is pleasing to Him” ( Eph.5:10 ), and your body is willing to be “led by the Spirit of God” ( Rom.8:14 ). Then, each of life’s obstacles– and they come in “good” and “bad” forms as evidence by Mr. Baillie’s prayer, is an opportunity to learn more, and do more, toward the ultimate goal of heaven!

J.C. Balch (you’re welcome to join us at Beverly’s Cafe, 7:30!). As Bro. J.C. is on the plus side of ninety years old, we enjoy his stories from yesteryear.  The last time we met, he told us about some of his early work experiences in Austin where he substituted for the “PBX” (private branch exchange) telephone operator. This experience was considered valuable by the military when he enlisted (WWII). But what struck me as funny was what he was told by the officer making the work assignments for incoming personnel. After stating that they already had several coming that were specifically trained in military communications systems, he told J.C., “We don’t have time to train you, so we’ll just put you in charge!” So, due to his lack of training, J.C. was made the corporal in charge of the trained men!  This reminds me of the cliché, “Those who can’t do, coach”- with apologies to coaches who can usually “out play” their charges with knowledge and experience even if their talent and abilities have diminished due to age. Such things are usually said or written by “Monday morning” or “armchair coaches” who have never had any “training” at coaching, and probably can’t play either! Believe it or not, the New Testament addresses these issues of training and teaching in the spiritual realm in a couple of passages.    James 3:1 states, “Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, knowing that as such we shall incur a stricter judgment.”  James is not in any way diminishing the role, responsibilities, or need for bible teachers. In fact, he is doing just the opposite, by indicating that those who do teach should have adequate preparation for the task in knowledge, experience, and wisdom. There are always some who want the supposed “prestige” of being a teacher without having first done the necessary work to educate themselves. Paul mentioned this to Timothy by way of warning, “…wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions,”  1Timothy 1:7 . This leads us to our next point.   There is always a need for bible teachers- both public and private, “who because of practice have trained their senses to discern good and evil,”  Hebrews 5:14 . Such does not require a degree in theology, or even formal training, but it does demand dedicated commitment to, and understanding of, the basic principles and purpose of the Scriptures. In Acts 8 , Christians driven from their homes by persecution “went about preaching the word,”  v.4 . These were not apostles (they stayed in Jerusalem, v.1 ), or even trained evangelists, but they were Christians of deep faith who earnestly desired salvation for others- and were willing to work for and toward that goal. Consider Matthew 5:13-16 , the salt and light passage. It was not spoken or written to the preachers and pastors, but to those with the most power to teach by daily contact with, and example to, the world! But again, this leads us to another (and final) point.   Preachers and Pastors should know how, and be active in, teaching- “preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with great patience and instruction”   2Timothy 4:2 .The reason for Paul’s admonition to Timothy is also given in the next verse, “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance with their own desires; and will turn away their ears from the truth…” Simply put, those primarily responsible for the public proclamation of God’s word, i.e. preachers and pastors (see also 1Timothy 3:2 and Titus 1:9ff ) should be capable private teachers also. As in other aspects of Christian duty, they should, in fact, set the example for others to follow in this regard, 1Peter 3:3 ! Perhaps all too often, preachers and pastors view their roles as being pulpit-oriented; and such is surely part of their responsibilities as the passages above indicate. But, given that they are supposed to be men of knowledge, wisdom, experience, and ability, shouldn’t they also be leading the way in the more private work of personal evangelism?  Kitchen tables and coffee tables are just as effective as pulpits in teaching the gospel- probably more so. Let’s use them all to tell others of the wonderful salvation offered by Jesus Christ whether we are preachers, pastors, or just Christians with genuine love and concern for the souls of others."],"title":["Preaching and Teaching the Word"],"_resultNumber":115,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/preaching_and_teaching_the_word","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":115},{"body":["First, please understand the difference between “preacher” and “pastor,” for although one man can wear both of these hats, the terms are not synonymous. “Preacher” comes from the Greek word  kerusso   , and simply refers to one who functions as a “herald” or “proclaimer”- thus, John the Baptist and Noah were both “preachers,” cf. John 1:6-8 ; 2Peter 2:5 . However, neither of these men were “pastors” as the term is used in the New Testament. “Pastor” is translated from the Greek (Greek was the original language of the New Testament) word  poimen   , and refers generally to “a shepherd.” But, the term is also specifically used of an office in the church which is synonymous with Elders, Overseers, and Bishops (see Acts 20:17,28 where all four terms are used to describe to the same office).  Additionally, there are specific qualifications given for Pastors/Elders/Bishops/Overseers in 1Timothy 3 and Titus 1 that not all “preachers” meet. For instance, though Paul was certainly a preacher ( cf. 1Timothy 2:7 ), he was not a Pastor because, having never been married, he could not meet the qualification of being “the husband of one wife,”  1Timothy 3:2 . With these things out of the way, let’s get to the point.   Preachers and Pastors need  patience . Patience is listed in Galatians 5:22ff as being part of the “fruit of the Spirit” every Christian should possess, but perhaps these two roles of preaching and pastoring require even more than a normal amount. Why is this so? Consider that preaching and pastoring are well-illustrated with two bible examples: 1) raising crops or livestock; and 2) raising children.  Preaching the word is obviously compared to “sowing seed” in Luke 8:5ff and 1Corinthians 3:6-7 ; and Jesus compared His efforts to teach the Word of God to that of a shepherd providing for sheep in Mark 6:34 . If you have any doubt that much patience is needed in these agrarian pursuits, then you’ve never lived that life, and you’re evidently unfamiliar with James 5:7 , “…Behold, the farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it, until it gets the early and the late rains.” Now here’s the point: preaching the word of God and/or pastoring His flock (at least doing them right) requires the same great patience as preparing soil, planting seed, watering and tending the plant as it grows,and continuing to feed and protect it until it matures and bears fruit just like its farming counterpart. And, anyone who has ever raised livestock can tell you of the patience likewise required in that endeavor ( cf. 1Peter 2:25a ).  Preaching and/or pastoring is also compared to having and raising children, cf.1Corinthians 4:15 ; Galatians 4:19 ; 1Timothy 1:2 . It requires the same kind of love, sacrifice, and dedication, as well as lots and lots of patience. Important “life lessons” must be patiently repeated over and over again. Mistakes that are made must be treated with generous amounts of love, compassion, empathy, and patience- since they possibly will be repeated a couple of times before being overcome. Often, we have to try to “be happy while you wait” (which was my wife’s great definition of “patience” she often repeated to our boys when they were little) while those lessons taught in the formative years seem to lay dormant before finally springing forth in the understanding and application of maturity. Undoubtedly, raising “spiritual” children is a lot like raising “physical” children in that both require tremendous amounts of patience! Paul wrote to Timothy on this point, “And the Lord’s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition; if perhaps God will grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth…” ( 2Timothy 2:24-25 )  “So, where does the part about ‘Pews and Parking’ from the title come into play?” Preachers and Pastors who have and manifest the kind and amount of patience the Lord requires of them in their roles may progress into trouble having sufficient “pews” and “parking” to accommodate the people in their congregations (enough “P’s” yet?). But, the inverse is also true: Preachers and Pastors who lack the kind and amount of patience the Lord requires of them in their roles will probably have plenty room in the pews and parking lots of their congregations!"],"title":["Preacher’s and Pastor’s Patience Progresses to Problems with Pews and Parking"],"_resultNumber":116,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/preachers_and_pastors_patience_progresses_to_problems_with_pews_and_parking","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":116},{"body":["A well-meaning lady once kindly chided me for what she perceived to be the “negative” tenor of some of the sermons I was preaching. “You know you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar,” she said. Before I could get the emergency brake on my tongue fully yanked, I responded with something along the lines of, “That’s fine, if you’re catching  flies  , but I’m trying to save  souls  !” I don’t think she appreciated my point, though I have often thought about hers...  There are still some, probably much more by now, who think the way to “attract more people to the church” is by “accentuating the positive” (and ignoring the “negative”- though they would perhaps not readily admit to that last part). But even the progenitor of “positive thinking” himself, Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, admitted that “Most of us would rather be ruined by praise than saved by criticism.”  So-called “positive” preaching is fine, provided you mean by that terminology the positive aspects of education in the Book, edification (being built-up ) in the faith, and encouragement to do that right we understand to be right in the sight of God. This kind of “positive” preaching produces knowledge of the Scriptures and calm assurance and comfort in our faith- and there is certainly nothing wrong with that!  But there are a couple of problems with a pure “honey” approach (exclusively “positive”) to preaching and teaching the Gospel. First, it necessarily and admittedly seeks to attract people “to the church” rather than “to Christ.” How so? Listen closely to the people who generally advocate this approach. They speak in terms of attracting people to, and bringing people into, “the church.” The church is the  result  of people being saved- not the  cause  of it. The gospel is “God’s power to save”- not the church, Romans 1:16 . We don’t “grow the church” by attracting people to it; we seek to save souls to heaven by preaching the gospel- all of it, whether it is “positively” or “negatively” perceived.  To illustrate the point, consider this: Was the sermon on Pentecost “positive”? The audience was told they had crucified the Son of God, and needed to “Repent and be baptized for the remission of sins” ( Acts 2:36-38 ). That doesn’t really fit the “positive” mold. But notice carefully what happened next. “So then, those who received the word were baptized; and there were added (to the church, PCS) that day about three thousand souls.” The preaching told people they needed to change, not that God would love and accept them as they were, which would make it “negative” by today’s standards. The preaching wasn’t “positive,” but it sure had “positive” results because it identified sin, and provided the necessary remedy for it.  All of which brings us to the second problem with a “pure honey” approach: it seeks to bring people to the church with something other than “the whole counsel of God,”  Acts 20:27 . The gospel certainly has “positive” aspects, cf. Matthew 11:28-30 ; Romans 8:31-39 ; but it also has prohibitions and warnings which are clearly “negative,” cf. Matthew 7:13-23 ; Romans 11:22ff ; et al . How are men to be saved from their sins if those sins are never shown to be “sinful,” cp. Romans 7:7 ? None of us like to be told we are wrong, or that we’re doing wrong, but unless we’re already perfect and thus don’t need salvation, it has to happen to be “transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is good and acceptable and perfect,” ( Romans 12:2 )!  The truth is this: The kind of preaching and teaching done produces the kind of members you have (and to some degree, vice versa, cf. 2Timothy 4:3 ). If you have only arrogant, self-righteous, “condemn everyone” preaching which is “all vinegar,” you’ll probably have those kinds of members. But if you have only soft, emotionally-based and weak “all honey” preaching which is only “positive,” (again, by modern standards) you’ll likely have those kinds of members too. Neither of these approaches is right.   2Timothy 4:1-5 contains the inspired prescription, “I solemnly charge you (Timothy and other preachers of the Gospel, PCS)…. preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with great patience and instruction…be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.” This kind of preaching won’t catch many “flies,” but it will save a lot of “souls.” Besides, I never really liked flies anyway!"],"title":["Catching Flies"],"_resultNumber":117,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/catching_flies","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":117},{"body":["“A month of Sundays” is an old expression that typically was used to mean “a long time”- as in, “I haven’t seen you in a month of Sundays!” But like many such expressions, the true meaning is not exactly like, and is sometimes just the opposite of, what was intended. For instance, have you ever tried to “shoot fish in a barrel”? The water deflects the bullet and splashes so much that you can’t even see the fish after the first shot, let alone hit one! So too it is with “a month of Sundays”- though perhaps used to mean a “long time,” it actually can be a very short one- at least from one perspective. Please consider…  Sunday rolls around once every week, obviously. Therefore, it would take 30 or 31 weeks of real time to make “a month of Sundays”! If we pursue the math further, it would then also take seven years to produce “a year of Sundays”. That sure sounds like a long time!  But let’s turn this around a little, and look at it from a different perspective. If you attend religious services “every Sunday,” how much actual time are you devoting to worshipping God, encouraging your brethren, and learning from God’s word? A person 21 years old will have will have had 3 years total of spiritual devotion, but only    if   he has attended every Sunday, and spent all day at it for all 21 years of his life! What if, on the other hand, he has only committed one hour to his weekly devotion, or has only made half of the Sundays? The numbers drop dramatically, and it obviously takes a lot longer to make a “month” or “year” of Sundays, doesn’t it?  Let’s make one more comparison while we’re at it. The average school age child spends roughly seven hours per day at school for 175 days per year for a total of 1,225 hours per year. When we multiply those 1,225 hours of instruction by twelve years of education, we get 14,700 total hours needed to graduate (obviously these are very general numbers given just for comparison purposes). If we “study” the Bible for one hour per week every Sunday morning, do you know how long it will take to equal the “graduation level” of 14,700 hours of public education? It would take 287 years !  That’s enough math- now let’s get the rubber to the road, so to speak. If we only spend one hour per week studying our Bibles at the Sunday morning service, we can’t live long enough to match the equivalent (in instruction time) of a high school education. That “month of Sundays” doesn’t sound like much of a long time anymore, does it? Is there any wonder that many who claim to be Christians are at best “remedial,” if not “illiterate,” in real knowledge of God’s word?  Actually, we’re being generous with the “one hour per week” estimate of instruction from the Bible in most congregations for the Sunday morning service. I don’t know of any congregation that consistently has hour-long sermons anymore, and such isn’t the point either. Instead, the point is that if we believe attending a religious service (even every Sunday morning) and receiving one hour of instruction (even if such really happened) is going to be sufficient for us to be mature Christians who know “the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation” ( 2Timothy 3:15 ), we are sadly mistaken- if not self-deluded.  Some of us are proud of ourselves when we “attend church” almost every Sunday morning. Don’t misunderstand, that’s a great start. But please don’t place on “the preacher” the burden to pour into your heart and mind what you need to know to reach heaven in one 30 or 40-minute sermon once a week for 300+ years! Instead, why not give true “ diligence to present(ing) yourself to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, handling accurately the word of truth,”  2Timothy 2:15 .  The noble-minded Bereans had it right. They: “received the word with great eagerness”­- the right attitude;  “examining the Scriptures daily” - the right practice ; “to see whether these things were so”- the right purpose , Acts 17:11 . The rewards for that kind of commitment to really understanding and living God’s word are truly “out of this world”!"],"title":["“A Month of Sundays”"],"_resultNumber":118,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/a_month_of_sundays","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":118},{"body":["The level of credence we give to some statements is often determined by who said or wrote them. If the author or speaker is someone we consider wise, successful, or in perhaps the worst case scenario, popular or famous, we listen to and consider their words. In short, we pay more and better attention because of the source. Such is not necessarily bad. But of course, the value of this process is dependent upon the inherent quality of our basis of evaluation. If we give credence to what someone says because they’re famous instead of understanding and wise, we’re setting ourselves up for disappointment and misery. Statements should stand on their own merits- they are either “true” or “false” regardless of who said them. However, that’s not our reality since “who” made them often supersedes what is written or said in our evaluations.  Unfortunately, we take this same flawed system of evaluating validity into our reading and applications of Scripture. Some people only pay attention to the “red letters” in the Bible. The “red letters” are the recorded words of Jesus. Obviously, we should pay close attention to the statements made by the Son of God and Savior of the world, but do those “red letters” really deserve more consideration than the “black ones”?  Consider a “red letter” statement in John 14:26 about the then future inspiration of the apostles by the Holy Spirit, “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.” If the Spirit’s mission was to remind the apostles of everything Jesus said, should we give less attention to the things they wrote by the Spirit’s inspiration- even if recorded in “black letters”? Notice also John 16:13 on this same point, “But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak of His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.” When Jesus said (in “red letters”) that His apostles would be guided “into all truth” by the Spirit, can we really devalue what they wrote in “black letters”? Paul said he wrote by the revelation of the Spirit so that “when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,”  Ephesians 3:3-5 . Again, this begs the same question as before: Can we diminish that which God revealed by the Spirit to the inspired writers of the New Testament because they are in “black,” rather than “red,” letters? Certainly not, but these things do lead us to an additional consideration.  Not only do we tend to distinguish and devalue the “black” letters in favor of the “red” ones in the sacred text, we evidently have an additional, though perhaps subconscious, line of demarcation: apparently there are “red” and “redder” letters. Even within the “red” letters, there are some passages that we are inclined to accentuate more heavily than others- or there are some that we apt to overlook completely in favor of others. Note an example. Jesus indeed said, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature” in Mark 16:15 ; but He also said, “Do not give that which is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine” in Matthew 7:6 . We tend to ignore that He was speaking specifically to His apostles rather than “us” in the first case, and that “we” are expected to use some discretion and judgment in our efforts to spread the word in the second instance. Matthew 15:14 is similarly often ignored, though recorded in “red” and on the same point.  How about another example? Jesus clearly taught that those who would be His disciples should be concerned with, and help, their fellowman, Luke 10:25-37; Mark 10:21 ; et al . But are you also familiar with His statement in Mark 14:7 ? There He said, “For the poor you always have with you, and whenever you wish, you can do them good…” If we emphasize the first set of statements, and deemphasize or ignore the other one, we could become so involved in the physical needs of our fellowman so as to forget that his spiritual needs are actually more important, cf. John 6:26-27 .  So, what’s the solution to our tendencies with regard to “black” vs. “red” vs. “redder” letters? The answer is found in 2Timothy 3:16 , “All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.” Understand that no passage of Scripture contradicts another; and therefore the correct view of any passage (or principle) is found through harmonizing it with everything else the Bible says on the subject- whether it is found in “red” or “black” letters!"],"title":["Black, Red, and Redder Letters"],"_resultNumber":119,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/black_red_and_redder_letters","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":119},{"body":["There seems to be a growing disappointment manifested by “older folks” (pre, present, and some post “Baby Boomers”) toward “younger folks” (whatever Generation name is utilized- X, Y, Z, Millennial, etc.) First, let’s all admit the truth of the old axiom about acorns, or nuts as the case may be, not falling very far from the tree. Whatever faults of character or tendencies that the “younger generation” manifests are surely the product of the influences of us “older” folks. Whether genetically or environmentally, we were the trees that produced the acorns!   Therefore, where they fall is largely up to us. It was “our job” as fathers (and mothers and grandparents) to “bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord,”  Ephesians 6:4 ; Titus 2:4-5 . Even outside the spiritual realm, we “adults” have to accept responsibility for that which we have produced or encouraged in them- even if it was done by neglect of duties and lack of guidance. I’m not, however, suggesting I agree that anything is necessarily “wrong” with “the younger generation.” They have their obstacles to overcome, and both assets and liabilities with which to do so, as has had each previous generation. Besides, I’m not about to bash the “younger generation”- I may need their help with my cell phone or internet connection!  But these things notwithstanding, give some contemplative time to this: “If young adults pick and attend a college or university for social rather than educational reasons, they will probably be very popular dropouts.” Why is this? The reasons for “going to college” matter- in fact, probably more than anything else, they determine the “success” of the venture. If secondary education is secondary to social environment and socializing in that environment, true “education” rarely occurs. That’s not hard to predict or see, but let’s follow this thread just a little further.  How did “young people” get to the point of viewing higher education mainly as a social opportunity? Could it be that we “older folks” encouraged this perspective by catering primary education to social influences instead of insisting that education be primary? Didn’t we attempt to make education “fun” to the point that learning and knowing became subordinate to “enjoyable” and “socially acceptable”? We even allowed incremental promotions to be based on “social” factors rather than academic achievement. What did this teach “younger folks” to expect and desire?  Now, if you’re still reading, Thank-you. All of this hasn’t been written to lay blame at the proper feet for whatever generational failures that exist (or that we may think exist) in education or otherwise. There is a spiritual point that has been the intended objective of these observations and illustrations. Much like attending college, “going to church” has very poor results when we have the wrong motivations. If, because of similar experiences and past influences, we have come to view “social” purposes as the primary reason to attend church services, we, too, will likely miss the real opportunities and true purposes of the activity. In spiritual terms, we will probably also (or again?) become very socially popular dropouts. Or perhaps even worse, we will attempt to change the purposes for “worship” (praising God) and “bible study” (spiritual education) into something more socially pleasing (feel-good fun). The apostle Paul predicted this in 2Timothy 4:3-4 , “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance with their own desires; and will turn away their ears from the truth, and will turn aside to myths.”   So, how do we “fix” this? 1) We realize and accept that “worship” is first and foremost about praising God rather than pleasing ourselves, Hebrews 13:15 . 2) We realize and accept that “bible study” is first and foremost about spiritual education (learning what the bible teaches) rather than social enjoyment, 2Timothy 3:16-17 ; Ephesians 4:11-16 . 3) We realize and accept that although “worship” and “bible study” have social benefits that  result  from assembling with those of “like precious faith” and common spiritual goals,these social benefits cannot be made the  objective  of these activities and still remain true to God’s spiritual purposes, 1Corinthians 11:20-30 . The “success rate” is much better in college and church when we attend for the right reasons.

They were both advanced in years at the time (he was 75 and she was 65). In fact, Isaac was not born to this couple for another twenty-five years! Now in the interim, after the promise of a son had been made to them by God but before Isaac was actually born, Abraham and Sarah tried a couple of times to “help God out,” so to speak.  First, they decided to just adopt a son born to a servant within their house. But God said instead to Abraham, “ This man will not be your heir; but one who shall come forth from your own body, he shall be your heir.” ( Genesis 15:4 ) Next, and since God said it would be Abraham’s own son, Sarah decided that she was the problem. So, she gave Abraham her handmaid to bear him a son- which she did. But again, God said this was not the way, “I will bless her (Sarah), and indeed I will give you a son by her.” ( Genesis 17:16 ) So, the couple finally decided to just wait for God to accomplish His purpose through them in His own way, and in His own time. Great decision! Isaac, the son of promise, was eventually born to the couple when Abraham was 100 years old and Sarah was 90! ( Genesis 21:5 〉 Genesis  17:17 )  The lesson for us in all of this is simple: When working for God, we have do His work in His way. Both of this couple’s efforts to “help God out” in the carrying out of God’s purpose through them were in error. They finally went back to whatthe Lord said, were patiently obedient to it, and He blessed them for it. That’s a great recipe for us!  So often today, we too want to “help God out” by attempting to do His work  in our way(s).  Friends, learn from Abraham and Sarah- it won’t work, and it often causes additional problems (note Genesis 16:4-6 ).  We try to “help God out” by inventing all kinds of programs you never read about in the Book. And then we need various administrators with titles and job descriptions you never read about in the Book to carry out all these programs you never read about in the Book. Then we need more money to pay these administrators you never read about in the Book to carry out all these programs you never read about in the Book. And then we need more fund raisers you never read about in the Book to pay these administrators you never read about in the Book to carry out all these programs that you never read about in the Book. And so on, and so on. It all starts with a failure to do God’s work in God’s way .  When God said He gave us “all things that pertain to life and godliness” ( 2Peter 1:3 ), and that the “Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work” ( 2Timothy 3:16-17 ), that means, if you’ll allow me, every work we need to be doing for God, and the proper way(s) to accomplish it, is found in the Book! If we don’t read about a “work” or “program” in the Book, it is work of man, not God, Matthew 15:7-9,13 .

Our motivations and intentions often determine how we act, even if the decision to act has already been made. Hebrews 4:12-13 makes it clear that God recognizes and judges our motives as well as our actions. This also seems to be the point Jesus was trying to get across in Matthew 5:21-48 .  I often write and preach things which are “corrective” in nature- lessons which seek to address commonly held misunderstandings and misapplications of God’s Word. I don’t do this to be different, or to attract attention. Neither is my purpose to prove that I’m right and others are wrong. God’s Word is “right” whether I am or not! Instead, the purpose I try to always keep in mind is to help others become right according to the Word. It is for this reason that I attempt to “contend earnestly for the faith which was once delivered to the saints,”  Jude 3 . Certainly, we should all be diligently “handling accurately the word of truth” that we can be “approved to God as a workman” who does not need to be ashamed, 2Timothy 2:15 ; but we should also be just as concerned with helping others to be the same. If we are primarily concerned with just “proving ourselves right” in our contending for the faith, without regard for the resulting impact on others, our motives and efforts are just plain wrong.  In writing to the young preacher Timothy on how to carry out his mission of preaching the Word, the apostle Paul gave these inspired instructions, “instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines, nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to mere speculation rather than furthering God’s provision which is by faith. But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. For some men, straying from these things, have turned aside to fruitless discussion, wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions,”  1Timothy 1:3-7 . See? The motives matter. Preaching, teaching, and discussing the Bible is not supposed to be about proving yourself right and others wrong- it is about “being right” with God  and  helping others to “be right” with God also! Faithful contenders for the faith are trying to produce in others the “ love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith ” of which Paul wrote. If this is not our objective, then we are just wrong, and wrongly motivated.  Hopefully, these points will help to explain a few things. I press hard for “accurately handling the word of truth” (again, from 2Timothy 2:15 ) because it matters. It is not simply “the truth” which “makes us free”- despite being often misquoted that way from John 8:32 . One can possess the truth without being made free by it. Most everyone has a Bible, or at least access to one. Does such make them “free”? Of course not! The rest of the verse, which is typically omitted, is, “and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” Having a Bible doesn’t make you a Christian anymore than owning a scalpel makes you a doctor. One has to know how to accurately use and apply the Truth to be made free by it, and to help others to be made free by it! Don’t get me wrong, one need not possess a PhD in Divinity to “handle accurately the word of truth” to his own and others’ benefit. But he must have accurate knowledge of the biblical text, and the right motive and purpose in mind for its use.  Truth matters. And the purpose and motivation for our use of it matters too. The Truth is able to make all people free from the shackles of sin and destruction, if we understand and handle it accurately, and thus apply it correctly."],"title":["“Being Right” vs. “Helping Others to Be Right”"],"_resultNumber":122,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/being_right_vs._helping_others_to_be_right","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":122},{"body":["In 2Corinthians 11:3 , the apostle Paul expresses his concerns over the potential apostasy of the Corinthian church this way, “But I am afraid, lest as the serpent beguiled Eve by his craftiness, your minds should be led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ.” A couple of major points become evident even from a cursory reading of this passage. For one, apostasy is a real possibility. It can happen, even to entire churches. Satan can lead whole congregations from safety in Christ to perdition with him if they are not careful. Secondly, notice that one of the means Satan utilizes to entice believers into defection is to complicate things- to make our devotion to God/Christ seem more complex and difficult than it really is. By the inspiration of God, Paul said devotion to Christ should be simple and pure. Do you find your Christianity and its devotion becoming increasingly complex? Watch out, Satan may have you targeted!  In the latter part of the first century, even as the New Testament was being written, Satan enticed men to apostasy through a doctrine called Gnosticism. Gnosticism is a great example of people being led away from pure and simple devotion to Christ because, well, Gnosticism is even difficult to define. Essentially, Gnosticism said that true “enlightenment,” and hence spiritual acceptance with God, came through knowledge, but that such knowledge was difficult to attain and only for a select few. That sounds exactly like the kind of thing about which Paul warned the Corinthians! In fact, many Christians of the late first and early second centuries were led astray by Satan through this apostasy. Certainly Christianity wasn’t supposed to be either mysterious or complex, and it certainly wasn’t for just a select few!  Becoming a Christian isn’t complicated either, nor does it require that some intricate set of rituals be followed to completion. Jesus stated the matter very plainly in the Great Commission, “Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. Whoever believes and is baptized shall be saved; but whoever does not believe shall be condemned.” ( Mark 16:15-16 , ESV)   To believe is to have faith. Belief/faith is not some “better felt than told” mystical experience for a lucky few. For everyone, it is the simple product of “hearing the word of God” ( Romans 10:17 ), and accepting it as such. Faith is coming to the realization that “He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him” ( Hebrews 11:6 ) in your mind, in your heart, and in your life. We can’t have faith unless we read and keep God’s words- it’s just that simple. Jesus said, “Why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?” ( Luke 6:46 ) That’s plain enough for anyone.    Baptism, the other half of Jesus’ plan of salvation, isn’t complicated either. The apostle Peter said, “baptism now saves you- not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience- through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,”  1Peter 3:21 . He is emphasizing that immersion in water (New Testament baptism) is not about getting physical dirt off of your body, but getting the spiritual removal of the stains of sin from the soul and conscience. Saul of Tarsus had seen and spoken with Jesus personally, and had apparently been praying for three days when God’s prophet Ananias said to him, “And now why do you delay? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name.” ( Acts 9:1-19; 22:3-16 )His personal interview with Jesus didn’t save him- neither did spending three days fasting and praying. But at this point, Saul believed in Jesus, and therefore all he yet needed was to be baptized “for the remission of sins” ( Acts 2:38 ). So that’s what Ananias told him to do: to be “baptized and wash away his sins.” Wasn’t that exactly what Jesus said was necessary for salvation in the Great Commission- belief and baptism ? Sure it was, pure and simple.   Now friends, that’s not difficult to comprehend or do. In fact, it’s about as uncomplicated as it could be. Why would we want to unnecessarily complicate God’s straightforward plan of salvation? Just obey it. And remember not to let Satan lead you away from “the purity and simplicity of devotion to Christ”!"],"title":["Pure, Simple, Devotion to Christ"],"_resultNumber":123,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/pure_simple_devotion_to_christ","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":123},{"body":["Washing the windows is a job no one really likes- unless you own a professional glass cleaning business, and are well paid to do it! But for most of us, window washing is a “have to” rather than a “want to” task. There are, however, some viable reasons for our less-than-enthusiastic attitude toward the job....  For one thing, window washing is a lot of trouble. It’s not usually just spraying some ammonia on the glass and wiping it off with a paper towel, which is why we don’t mind cleaning mirrors nearly as much as washing windows! Instead, it involves: removing all the screens; chipping off the dirt-dauber balls of concrete they manage to cement to the window frames despite the screens; dragging out the tangled, “Gordian knot” mess otherwise known as a water hose; fetching or borrowing a ladder, because you can never reach the top of the window without it; finding that handy-dandy soap-dispensing squeegee/brush combo apparatus that worked so well on that late night TV commercial (and cleaning the dirt-dauber nest out of its inlet too); and spending the better part of the day trying to figure out how to keep the soapy water from bouncing back off the window corners into your eyes. Then, there is also the troubling task of trying to figure out which screen went on which window, and constantly telling yourself, “I know it came off of one of these windows!” All of which is endured only to go back inside the house and discover streaks on every window! Then, and only then, your wife/husband hands you the phone number of a professional windowing cleaning service (insert exhausted, heavy sigh here).  It occurs to me that cleaning our windows is somewhat like cleaning our lives, in that:   Nobody really likes to do it, but it has to be done, or we suffer the consequences of a dirty and restricted view of things- not to mention the eternal consequences;  None of the “gadgets” really work- or even make the job any easier, and can make it even more difficult;  The actual tools required are simple and readily available, it’s the work that is hard;  The more often you do it, the less dirt there is to clean, and the easier the job becomes; and,  No matter how diligent you are in your cleaning, there are still going to be a few streaks and spots that you missed.   Now, these things aren’t written to depress you, or to discourage you from the task of cleaning your life, for such is surely God’s will! “Therefore, if a man cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful for the Master, prepared for every good work,”  2Timothy 2:21 . Instead, it is hoped that these simple comparisons between washing windows and cleaning your life manifest:   1) The importance of the task. It is, after all, a command of God, “Therefore, having these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God,”  2Corinthians 7:1 . Therefore, failing to “wash” ( Acts 22:16 ; 1Corinthians 6:11 ) and “cleanse” ( James 4:8 ) our lives leaves us dirty and unfit for God’s company either now, or eternally.   2) The benefit of regular effort. Your eyes are said to be the windows of your soul. Having windows that are “clean” changes your whole perspective of life. Unfortunately, the inverse is also true, just as Jesus said in Matthew 6:23 , “But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!” And finally,   3) The necessity of God’s grace. No one has the power to completely cleanse his life- Jesus has to do that by the gracious gift of His blood, Ephesians 1:7 . “If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness,”  1John 1:8-9 .  The point is simple: Just like washing windows, cleaning your life requires some diligence, but the view afterwards is well worth the effort!"],"title":["Washing Windows"],"_resultNumber":124,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/washing_windows","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":124},{"body":["Trust is a necessary part of human existence. The person who trusts no one is miserable because God created us with a need to trust others both emotionally and socially. But ideally, “trusting” has responsibilities on both sides- the object of our trust must be trustworthy , and we must be willing to be vulnerable enough to trust. That’s right, trust requires some degree of vulnerability because trust, well-founded or ill-founded, is an opening up of oneself to another. Trust is not perfect knowledge, in fact, by definition it can’t be, and it requires some surrendering of personal control. Therefore, the requirements of trust are the object being trustworthy, and us being trusting.   When it comes to trusting God, there can be no question of Him being worthy of our trust. Every plan of His for man, and every action ever taken by Him for man, was and is for our good. The degree of His love for us is without question, “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” ( Roman 5:8 ). Therefore, the New Testament emphasizes God’s faithfulness, and hence His trustworthiness, repeatedly by reminding us that “God is faithful”-  1Corinthians 1:9; 10:13 ; 2Corinthians 1:18 .  So the problematic part of this trust relationship between God and man is definitely on our side of the equation. For instance:   We don’t trust God’s promise to physically care for us if we trulyput him first in our lives . We often set aside worship, Bible study, and other acts of spiritual devotion and service because “I had to work.” Note carefully Jesus’ promise of Matthew 6:30-33 , “But if God so clothes the ﻿﻿ grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you? ﻿ You of little faith! Do not   ﻿   worry then, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear for clothing?’ For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for   ﻿﻿   your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But   ﻿   seek first   ﻿   His kingdom and His righteousness, and   ﻿﻿   all these things will be   ﻿   added to you.” We often salve our consciences with, “Well, I’ve got to provide for my family!” Do you really trust God’s promise? Please read the passage again. I understand (and surely so does God) that our jobs may at times require us to be at work instead of worship or Bible study, but can we really say we trust God’s promise to provide for us when we choose to work instead of putting Him first?   We also don’t trust God with the welfare of our families. I really should have added this point to last week’s article on the “Life Lessons” cancer and chemo taught me. So please allow me to return to that time once more. Facing stage 4 cancer was, to say the least, tough. But facing it with early teenage and pre-teen sons was a whole different matter. What would become of those precious boys? Sure, I had (and have!) a great, strong Christian wife- and they subsequently a wonderful mother who would do all for them possible. But who would teach them to be godly men? Who would teach them the life lessons they would need to become fine Christian men, husbands, and fathers? Who would help them with their cars, their girlfriends, their etc. etc. etc.? While ravaged physically by the disease and treatments, these things caused an emotional meltdown for me one day. Then in the midst of all my tears it hit me- God would provide a way for all of those necessary things to be provided if I were not here. And the unnecessary ones didn’t matter anyway. I just needed to trust God and stop worrying! After that realization, I was ashamed of my lack of faith and trust. But afterwards, I was “free” to face whatever was ahead with calm assurance. If I died at 39, that was “OK”- and my boys would be fine too because God would make it so. He would use my family and my spiritual brethren to take care of everything those two boys needed. Trusting God with the welfare of my family in my absence was incredibly emancipating!  Remember the opening sentence: “  Trust is a necessary part of human existence.” How true that becomes when facing the end of our earthly existence. I truly don’t understand how anyone could face death without trusting God. Are you trusting God with your “way” here in this life by “seeking first His kingdom and righteousness” ? Are you trusting God with your eternal destiny after this life is over for you by being and living as a Christian now? Are you trusting God with all that you will leave behind when you die?

The answer is actually pretty simple: Repentance requires us to change our minds, hearts, and lives. Not so easy? I said the answer was simple - I didn’t say it was easy!  Let’s begin with a clear picture of exactly what repentance is, and isn’t. Repentance is, as implied above, a change of mind and heart that leads to a change of course or direction. More graphically, it is deciding that you are going the wrong direction in life, making a U-turn, and then being happy about the change. Take these elements one at a time for a little more clarification.   The Decision. For anyone to truly repent, a change of mind has to take place. A bank robber may stop robbing for a while because he fears the police are on to him. He hasn’t repented though he has changed his behavior. There was no change of mind regarding the sinfulness of his activity, nor was there a change of heart (emotions or desires) either, just a fear of being caught. So, his behavioral change isn’t true repentance, it’s just a temporary modification that will inevitably revert back to its former state.   The Change. True repentance also requires a change of activity, course, or direction in life. To borrow from the same illustration of our bank robber, imagine that he reaches the conclusion that what he has been doing is just not right. He’s taking by force what belongs to others, and breaking both God’s and man’s laws by so doing. But, because he’s also unwilling to “work for a living,” he continues to rob banks anyway. He’s changed his mind regarding the rightness/wrongness of his activity, but has not changed his behavior. This can’t be repentance either- the end result of his life is exactly as it was; he just has a guilty conscience about it now!   The Emotion. Let’s go back our bank robber one last time. He changes his mind about the course of his life, and as a result, stops robbing banks and gets a job (as a security expert for the banking industry!). But, though he changed his mind and life, he isn’t happy about it. In fact, he’s miserable and misses the “excitement” of his former life, as well as the luxuries it provided him. Has he repented? He isn’t robbing banks anymore, and doesn’t intend to do so again, but he sure longs for his previous path. He’s doing the rightthings in his life, and even thinking and saying the rightthings in his job, but he doesn’t feel the right things! How long do you suppose he’ll stick to the “strait and narrow” way?  Do you see now why repentance requires a change of mind, activity, and emotion ? Just modifying one of the three requirements doesn’t result in lasting change. Again, the reason is simple: In modifying one part of himself, he failed to change all of himself. Repentance, to be effective, must change everything about us- our minds (decision-making processes), our activities (the overall course and direction of our lives), and our hearts (how we feel about this new direction relative to our past). Now, lest you think I’m pulling all of this out of my hat, note what the Bible says on the subject.    Matthew 3:8-9  . Hypocritical Jewish leaders came with the multitudes of believers to be baptized by John. These leaders were doing the right thing, but their minds were not right in this matter. Therefore, John told them they needed to “bring forth fruits in keeping with your repentance.” How does this indicate their repentance was incomplete in regard to their thinking? Consider the next verse, “and do not suppose that…. ‘We have Abraham for our father,’ for….” Their supposition- their thinking, was wrong. Just being baptized wasn’t going to change their minds- but their minds would surely have to be changed for them to truly repent!    Acts 2:37-38  . Those who had crucified Jesus as an imposter, once they became convinced that He was indeed the Christ, asked, “Brethren, what shall we do?” Their mindshad already been changed by the apostles’ sermon, but what remained? They needed to change their course and direction in life- they needed to go from being persecutors of Christ to being His disciples. So, they were told to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ!     2Corinthians 7:10  . Paul wrote, “the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation; but the sorrow of the world produces death.” When the mind and life have been changed, the heart must follow for true repentance to occur, for Jesus said, “for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also,”  Matthew 6:21 .  Now, have you truly repented by changing your mind , your course , and your desires ? Or, are you still fighting the battle with sin by attempting to change only part of yourself? Such is surely a losing battle!"],"title":["Requirements of Repentance"],"_resultNumber":126,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/requirements_of_repentance","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":126},{"body":["(For those who may not know, I was diagnosed with Stage 4 T-Cell Lymphoma in May of 2004, but by the grace of God, modern medicine, and the loving support of my families- both physical and spiritual, I’m obviously still hanging around.)  One of the advantages of having been forced to face your own mortality is the perspective it provides. The platitude, \"Live each day as if it could be your last- because one day it will be,\" has only limited effects and benefits toward providing real impetus for changes in perspective and focus. This is especially true in spiritual matters.  As long as death is a known but “distant” reality, contemplating its consequences is pretty much a theoretical rather than a practical endeavor. But, when one is faced with the very real possibility of dying “soon,” if not \"today,\" the practical implications of such dominate the thoughts and perspective in a way that is difficult to achieve otherwise. Facing mortality in an “up close and personal way” inevitably changes the perspective, and subsequently the focus, of what was previously thought of as “life.” Simply put: We think differently about our spiritual life when our physical one has a good chance of ending   today  . There are many emotions that surely come with and through this process. But, the real changes in perspective, focus, and activity come when we are truly \"OK\" with dying TODAY , if such should be. This “comfort level” with death is truly a liberating epiphany, but how do we get to such a life-changing perspective short of receiving a mortal diagnosis?  The ability to think and live comfortably with the “reality of death- even today” is the growth of a part of faith that we don't think or talk about as much as we should. We emphasize the knowledge of faith which is its foundation, Romans 10:17 , “So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” We also underscore the obedience of faith which is its effect, James 2:14-26 , “…Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead….”. But what we typically ignore, or at least fail to accentuate as much as we should, is the trust of faith that is its present benefit. In 2Corinthians 1:8-10 , note that Paul spoke of his afflictions and excessive burdens that were ultimately relieved by his  trust  in God. “For we do not want you to be unaware, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life; indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves in order that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead….He on whom we have set our hope.”   This trust aspect of faith not only pertains to eternal salvation once death has occurred, but also provides present peace and confidence that whatever family and unfinished physical details we leave behind will be graciously cared for and provided for by God and His children. It is this trust aspect of faith that enables our emancipation from the physical constraints of life, and allows our spiritual life to truly develop, grow, and flourish. If our “faith” is only comprised of the knowledge and obedience components, but lacks this trust element, we will live only in the imprisonment of our fear and dread of death. But true “faith” in Jesus delivers “those who through the fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives,”  Hebrews 2:15 . Perhaps this is the primary reason so many of us cling to physical life so tenaciously that we are consumed by its preservation and affairs. Unfortunately, such also renders us incapable of saying (and living) Paul’s words of Colossians 3:1-3 , “If then you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on the earth. For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.”   True biblical faith has knowledge as its base and obedience as its effect, but must also have trust as its current benefit to enable us to live lives that are truly emancipated and spiritual.

If it doesn’t, why did God go to all the trouble of inspiring men to write the New Testament? If it doesn’t, why is the New Testament so replete with warnings to, and corrections of, Christians? If it really doesn’t, why did Jude urge us to “contend earnestly for the faith” ( v.3 ); why did Paul warn Timothy about the perversion of truth ( 1Timothy1:6-7 ; et al ); and why did Peter spend an entire chapter to help us recognize, identify, and combat false prophets ( 2Peter 2 )?  None of that makes any sense at all if “it doesn’t really matter what you believe and practice as long as you’re honest and sincere.” Honesty and sincerity do not change the wrongness and impotence of either beliefs or practices. A person who honestly and sincerely believes that heading south on highway 69 will get him from Jacksonville to Dallas will never make it there. And a person who honestly and sincerely takes the wrong spiritual road does not arrive in heaven either.  But the underlying culprit in Satan’s destructive deception is the concept of  subjective salvation  . Since the word “salvation” is pretty clear as to its meaning, let’s concentrate for a moment on the “subjective” part of this pair of terms. “Subjective” refers to an impression or conclusion that is based on someone’s feelings and opinions, rather than on facts and evidence. It is, therefore, necessarily biased . “Objective” means pretty much the opposite- that the conclusion or result is based solely on facts and evidence rather than personal feelings and opinions. Therefore, it is necessarily unbiased.   Now we’re ready for the question: Is one’s salvation subjective or objective? That is, is salvation based on the feelings and opinions of the individual, or is there an external and impartial determining factor? There is no doubt or argument that being saved should make us “feel” certain things and ways, but the crux of the issue is whether or not those feelings are themselves the evidence of salvation.  Let’s go first to biblical history for input. The patriarch Jacob was led by his sons to believe that Joseph, his favorite son, had been killed by wild beasts, cf. Genesis 37:18-33 . The deception worked in spite of the fact that Joseph was not at all dead. But Jacob was so convinced of Joseph’s death that “he refused to be comforted. And he said, ‘Surely I will go down to Sheol in mourning for my son’.” Jacob believed with all his heart (honestly and sincerely was absolutely convinced) that Joseph was dead, and continued to believe so for twenty-two years ( cp. Genesis37:34-35 〉 45:26-28 ). But Joseph was, in fact, alive and well. Jacob was honest and sincere in his beliefs- but he was honestly and sincerely wrong! Though he believed with all of his heart that Joseph was dead, the truth was that he was second-in-command over all of Egypt! This is subjectivism plain and simple . Jacob’s feelings and flawed impressions led him to believe something that was simply not true, and he thus lived accordingly for years before learning the objective truth: Joseph was alive.  So is salvation subjective? Let’s allow the Bible to speak for itself: “And by this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments.” ( 1John 2:3 ); “Little children, let no one deceive you, the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; the one who practices sin is of the devil….By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious; anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother.” ( 1John 3:7-8,10 ). Through obedience to the Spirit-inspired words of the New Testament, we “are being led by the Spirit of God…” and “The Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow-heirs with Christ…” ( Romans 8:14,16-17 ). Friends, that is objective salvation based on the impartial evidence of obedience in our lives to the Word of God, not subjective salvation based on the biased feelings of our emotions. Give it some thought, won’t you? It makes a difference eternally.","We can say Salvation is the act of saving or protecting from harm, risk, loss, destruction, etc.","Thus can say that it is the act of peace."],"title":["Subjective Salvation?"],"_resultNumber":128,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/subjective_salvation","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":128},{"body":["H. Osby Weaver (I just realized I don’t remember what the “H.” stood for!) was a preacher friend of mine way back when. He and his lovely wife, Mary Helen, were forty-two domino playing partners with Donna and me. Such was somewhat of an odd pairing, since they were among the oldest couples in the congregation, and Donna and I were among, if not the , youngest couple in the group there in Nacogdoches. But no matter, we were good friends. Osby was the preacher for the church there at the time, and I was just starting to preach regularly.  Though I didn’t especially care for Bro. Osby’s manner of presentation- he was very dry and somewhat monotone when speaking publicly, I loved his knowledge of the sacred text, and greatly appreciated his wisdom in the application of it. He was among the first to encourage me to preach “full-time.” Though his sermons weren’t my favorites, I learned a lot from him nonetheless. But in more private settings, like around the domino table, Osby had a great wit and keen sense of humor. Every once in a while, both would break through that serious façade of his to make a great point of application from the Truth.  Once Osby was being questioned, or perhaps challenged (and he usually didn’t appreciate or deal particularly well with either) by a young college student who apparently thought pretty highly of his own opinions and judgments- even in comparison to those of the venerable old servant of the cross. This young man was trying to defend attending “R-rated” movies because, as he put it, “They almost always contain at least one good life lesson.” The unflappable wise one simply replied, \" You might also find one good biscuit at the city dump, but the city dump is a bad place to look for good biscuits.\" You’ve just got to love logic and reason like that! The young man got the point, whether or not he took it to heart is another matter entirely.  What Bro. Weaver so eloquently and succinctly stated was the same, in essence, as the principle stated by inspiration in a couple of places. James 4:4 reads, “You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.” And, 2Corinthians 6:14 adds, “…what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?” What both of these texts are emphasizing is the point the young man was trying avoid: God expects those who would be godly to separate themselves from ungodliness. There are just some activities in which a Christian ought not participate, and should not desire to do so. We can try to justify or excuse our involvement any way we choose, but the truth remains steadfast: “The city dump is just a bad place to look for good biscuits!”  Bro. Osby wasn’t trying to legislate what was “right” and “wrong” for this young man by creating and maintaining an arbitrary set of rules- and neither am I. But, if we really want to be godly and live lives of holiness, barraging our senses with ungodly and unholy sights and sounds isn’t going to help, cf. Roman 13:14 . The real problem this young man faced is one with which we all must deal. It is the inner conflict between wanting to belong to and be saved by God, and still yet wanting to be like and to be liked by the world. Perhaps Jesus said it best, “No one can serve two masters…”,  Matthew 6:24 . We must choose which it will be for us- it simply cannot be both godliness and worldliness, cf. 1John 1:6; 3:7-10 .  Are you looking for “good biscuits in the city dump”? Though you might occasionally find one there, the city dump “is a bad place to look for good biscuits!”"],"title":["Good Biscuits at the City Dump"],"_resultNumber":129,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/good_biscuits_at_the_city_dump","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":129},{"body":["Do you remember the prayer little children used to be taught to recite at bedtime? “Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep; if I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. God bless…(insert a list typically beginning with Mommy and Daddy and proceeding through siblings, grandparents, friends, and winding up with Snowball the cat or Freddy the frog)”. Think about this little prayer for moment. Is the thought of “dying before I wake” really the one you want your child to have before you try to get them to sleep? Good luck with that!  However, from a more adult perspective, there are some very good “grown-up” considerations that can be gleaned from this well meaning but perhaps ill-conceived “child’s” prayer.   The prayer recognizes the brevity of this life. Scripture certainly teaches this lesson: James 4:13-14 , “Come now, you who say, ‘Today or tomorrow, we shall go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.’ Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.” Most of us have had all-too-vivid reminders of this lesson. A family member or close friend is here one day, and everything seems fine- then suddenly, he’s gone. The transient nature of life has examples all around us, and yet some of us never really learn the lesson. What’s the lesson? Each day could be  my  last upon the earth, and each night when  I  pillow  my  head,  I  really could “die before  I  wake”!  While it may not be the best thing to burden a four-year old with such thoughts (let them think about God blessing relatives and pets- even the slimy ones), this is a great lesson for us bigger folks. We need to be reminded that life is short, and that each day or night could be our last. However, the more important question is this: Are we OK with this day or night being our last, if it should turn out that way?  A lot of people give lip serviceto the notion of “living each day as if it could be your last.” And that’s OK, I suppose. But until we are really OK with dying “today,” such is just lip service, or a poor excuse for selfishly pursuing our own desires to the exclusion of responsibilities. This leads us to the other “big person” consideration from this little prayer.   The prayer emphasizes trusting God. The potentially sleep-depriving “If I die before I wake” is offset somewhat by “I pray the Lord my soul to take.” Though we might question the age-appropriateness of the lesson for a child, the point is “spot on” for grown-ups! When we hesitate or equivocate at the question, “Are you ready to die  today  ?” (in spiritual terms, of course), it is usually due to one of two reasons: 1) We know we are not ready, and thus “our heart condemns us,”  1John 3:18-21 ; or, 2) We don’t really trust God. Our head knows all the right things to think (and say) about our own mortality, but our heart still doubts because we do not fully trust Him. Let me illustrate.  One of the great blessings of Stage 4 T-Cell Lymphoma was that of being forced to face mortality up close and personal. Getting to the point of truly being OK with dying “today” was a big step. But looking at a young wife and two young sons knowing that my God and my family (spiritual and physical) would take care of them if today were “the time of my departure” ( 2Timothy 4:6 ) was liberating. It was also important developmentally because it required a level of trust I probably would not have otherwise achieved. I hope you can achieve that trust without cancer and chemo!  Whether you recited that “little” prayer or not, have you learned the “big” lessons of recognizing and accepting the brevity of this life, and truly trusting God with not only your eternal destiny, but with the care of those left behind?"],"title":["“Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep…”"],"_resultNumber":130,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/now_i_lay_me_down_to_sleep","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":130},{"body":["The last two editions have been on “Love and Trust” as the foundation of any human relationship, and “Loving the Word” as the single most important factor in determining our eternal destiny, respectively. In this concluding article of this trio, let’s consider the essentiality of “Trusting the Word.”  What does it mean to “trust the Word”? The meaning of “trust” can be seen through some of its synonyms, like  conviction   , dependence , reliance , and  confidence  . So, are your  convictions  based on the Word of God (book, chapter, and verse), or someone else’s faith, Colossians 3:18 ? Do you  depend  on the Word of God to guide your steps in life, or on the wisdom of men, 1Corinthians 1:20 ? Do you  rely  on the Word of God in times of doubt and trouble, or on your own understanding, Proverbs 3:5 ? Is your  confidence  of an eternal reward based in the Word of God, or your own emotions, 1John 2:3-6 ? Now let’s ask the question again, “Do you really ‘trust the Word,’ or is that just lip service, Matthew 15:8-9 ?”  However, there is another set of applications regarding “trusting the Word” that we really need to consider. “Do we really ‘trust the Word’ enough to be willing to: base our convictions on it exclusively ; to depend on it rather than men’s wisdom in doctrine ; to rely on it in times of congregational trouble ; and to have confidence in it to attract and save men’s souls ?” Let’s consider these individually for a moment.   “Do we really ‘trust the Word’ enough to base our convictions on it exclusively ?” Or, do we tend to rely instead on the faith of our family or friends to tell us what to believe, and where to “go to church”? If we really trust the Word to be “inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work” ( 2Timothy 2:16-17 ), on what or who else do we need to base our convictions? Trust the Word, Matthew 10:37 !   “Do we really ‘trust the Word’ enough to depend on it rather than men’s wisdom in doctrine?”  If we can’t determine what we should believe, teach, and practice doctrinally without input from some man, publication of men, college, or denominational headquarters, we really don’t “trust the Word” at all. The Bible was written to be read, understood, and followed, Ephesians 3:3-5 , and through these, to provide entrance to eternal life. Therefore, my or your understanding of it shouldn’t require some sort of “clergy” or “headquarters” explanation. Surely the God who created man “of the dust” and gave him life can communicate with him in language that he can understand. Trust the Word, 1Corinthians 2:10-13 !   “Do we really ‘trust the Word’ enough to rely on it in times of congregational trouble?”  Or, do we look for help from any and every other source? Let’s be clear, “congregational troubles” almost always come from failures to trust and follow God’s Word in the first place- and can only be cleared up by reversing course and “Remember(ing) therefore from where you have fallen, and repent(ing) and do(ing) the deeds you did at the first….”  Revelation 2:5 . But all too often, when problems pop up, we want to call this preacher or that one, or resort to some other human source for advice. Instead, knees and noses are the key- get on your knees in prayer to the Father , and put you nose in His Book. Trust God and the Word, 1Peter 2:1-3 !   “Do we really ‘trust the Word’ enough to have confidence in it to attract and save men’s souls?”  Or, will we succumb to the egotistical urges of our humanity to want to “help” God by “dressing up” the gospel so it will appeal to the fickle and those otherwise uninterested in it? Will we trust its power to save, or feel the need to adorn it with food and entertainment? Will we “preach the word, ” or file off its “rough edges” to make it more appealing and palatable to the masses? Will we trust “the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified,”  Acts 20:32 ; or put our confidence in various “programs” and devices it never mentions to draw men to God and save their souls? Trust the Word, Romans 1:16 !  Love and trust are the foundations of every relationship we humans sustain. They are also the basis of our relationship with God.

The application is typically that God causes even terrible events to have good outcomes if patience and trust are present. Please note this verse carefully, “And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.” Let’s consider this verse and its context a little closer to see if it really promises all that some might expect, or in the way they expect.   The promise of this verse is limited to “those who love God” and those who “are called according to His purpose.”  It is not universal in its scope. The chapter began a consideration of blessings and promises given to those “in Christ Jesus,”  vv.1ff . So, the promise of v.28 must be limited to “those who love God” and “who are called according to His purpose” who are also “in Christ.” This means that they have done, and continue to do, those things that put them in Christ,  cf. Galatians 3:26-29 (faith and baptism) and 1John 2:3-6 (keeping His commandments).   The promise of this verse is limited by the “all things” God has specifically in mind. Logic and the harmony of the Scriptures demand that “all things” is necessarily limited. Does the “all things” which God causes to work together for good include Satan, or his agents, or the sinful actions of self or others? Of course it doesn’t, for although God is certainly powerful enough to control Satan and to prevent the sinful actions of people from having disastrous consequences, He allows us the freedom to choose whom we will obey, Romans 6:16-21 . When we allow Satan to influence us to make bad decisions and sinful actions, bad things can and do happen. And the physical consequences of such are often irreversible. For example, if I decide to drink and drive, and kill a young mother in so doing, her husband is without a wife and her children without a mother, and I will likely spend the rest of my life behind bars. Is God then responsible for making “good” things to come from my sinful choices and activities? Such is not the promise of this verse.  So, what are we to conclude that “all things” of the verse includes? Note the spiritual helps that have already been listed in the chapter: Spiritual Freedom from condemnation through the “law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus,”  vv.1-4 ; Spiritual Guidance from the Spirit’s inspired provision of “the Law of God,”  vv.2,5-14 ; Spiritual Adoption/Validation as children of God through the Spirit’s witness,  vv.16-17 ; Spiritual Hope of eternal salvation that sustains us during the “sufferings of this present time,”  vv.18-25 ; and Spiritual Intercession by the Spirit in prayerto the Father, vv.26-27 . Why not understand “all things” of v.28 to be referring to these  spiritual helps  which have already been listed in the text under consideration, rather than trying to make them apply to every conceivable physical force, circumstance, and thing? Thus…   The promise of this verse is limited to the spiritual helps God has promised to those who love and obey Him. He has promised spiritual salvation, spiritual adoption, spiritual hope, and spiritual intercession to those who love and obey Him, but has not promised that physical “good” will come from bad circumstances brought about by evil influences and choices.   The promise of this verse is limited to what God determines and calls “good.”  Neither this verse, nor any other, obligates God to cause what we might deem “good” to occur for us (which usually relates to physical things ),even if we do love and obey Him. Remember that all but one of the apostles suffered tremendous persecutions and were killed for their faith! The simple fact is that we are not good determiners of what is “good” for us in the first place, Jeremiah 10:23 ; Isaiah 5:20 . Instead of the applications that are typically made of Romans 8:28 toward physical good as we see it, please realize that God  is  promising that all the spiritual helps He has provided will effect our  spiritual  and eternal good no matter what physical suffering or tragedy we encounter in life-  if  we use them to continue love, trust, and obey Him."],"title":["God’s Promise of Romans 8:28"],"_resultNumber":132,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/gods_promise_of_romans_828","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":132},{"body":["Donna and I were watching an old movie together on a rainy day recently when an advertisement came on for a major department store. At the end of the commercial, I noted that they would open at 8 PM on Thanksgiving Day. I asked Donna when they would close if they opened that late. She said they probably wouldn’t close- that they would likely be open all night heading into the follow day’s shopping frenzy. Then it hit us: Isn’t it amazing that we spend a few hours being “thankful” for what we have, then we can’t wait to finish up our “Thanksgiving” so we can rush out, compete (and sometimes fight, from what I understand), and run ourselves crazy in a feeding frenzy of shopping to get more stuff? Does this seem at least somewhat ironic, if not downright hypocritical to anyone else? (And just for the record, we tend to avoid crowds {except at church services!} - especially the piranha-type ones on “Big Sale” days.)  True thankfulness is linked in the Scriptures to contentment. There are a couple of N.T. passages that emphasize the importance of  contentment   - being satisfied (and happy) with what God has given us, see Philippians 4:11-13 and 1Timothy 6:6-8 . It is not coincidental that both of these passages are preceded in their contexts by verses that emphasize the importance of  thanksgiving   - obviously, being appreciative to God in prayer . Please note Philippians 4:6 , “Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God,” and also, 1Timothy 2:1 , “First of all, then, I urge that entreaties and prayers, petitions and thanksgivings , be made on behalf of all men…”. The point is that unless we are first  thankful for what we have, we will never enjoy the true blessing of contentment. And, if we don’t, we may continue “going through the motion” of being thankful, but will never reach contentment, which is really at least part of the point.  Please don’t misunderstand. I’m not suggesting that looking forward to and going shopping after Turkey-Day festivities is wrong, I’m just wanting us to stop and think for a moment or two about a couple of significant questions. “Are you/I really ‘thankful’ for the blessings God gives us?” And, “Have we learned the lessons of ‘contentment’ that deepen our thankfulness into true appreciation and trust?”  If you’re not sure whether or not you are truly thankful for and content with God’s blessings, consider 1Timothy 6:8   personally,   “And if we have food and covering, with these we shall be content.” What if “food” meant simply something to eat, instead of “turkey with all the trimmings” and every kind of side dish and dessert imaginable? And, what if “covering” meant clothes on your back and/or a roof over your head , instead of a new “thanksgiving outfit” and a $100,000 home furnished to the hilt? Would you still be “content” then? Could you be “thankful” then? Are these fair questions? Perhaps not, but they are questions we probably all would do well to soberly consider.  Think one step further with me. Matthew 6:33 says that if we “seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness,” that all these things (food, drink, covering) “will be added to you.” Do we really believe that? Do we really trust God enough to do what He said- to have Him and spiritual matters truly as the first and primary focus of our lives? Or, do we instead spend most of our time, energy, efforts, and concern on providing these essentials for ourselves? Even to the point that we push aside spiritual matters because we’re “too busy” with the material pursuits? Such surely isn’t trust, faith, contentment, or thankfulness.  God has surely blessed most of us far beyond our needs even to our wants, if not our luxuries. Let’s be content with whatever He has given us to the point of being truly thankful by putting Him first in our lives."],"title":["Thankfulness and Contentment"],"_resultNumber":133,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/thankfulness_and_contentment","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":133},{"body":["For a few years now it seems, we here at Southside have had “more than our fair share” of serious illnesses, deaths, and various other hardships and tribulations. Such is a normal part of life, I suppose, but it does seem that for a group of our size we’ve had an abundance. It makes you wonder at times if there is an Achan ( cf. Joshua 7 ) or Jonah ( Jonah 1 ) in our midst! Nah, I don’t believe that- I was just teasing. We have a good group of sincere people trying to do what it is right here at Southside. But we have had many opportunities, as a result of these trials, to learn and grow together. So what should we be learning? A few things, actually...    We ought to now know, for instance and if we didn’t know before, that:      Illnesses and death are just a part of life. God didn’t want or make the world that way– Satan did. In God’s original version of life here on the planet, there was no sickness, pain, or death. It was truly a utopian paradise! But Satan came along and helped Eden’s residents put an end to all that. Thus, through Satan’s influence and mankind’s weakness, “...sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men…” ( Rom.5:12 ). Sure, we can be saved from the spiritual consequences of our own sins through Christ (and thanks be to God for that!), but the aches, pains, diseases, and death have been and will be a part of life for us all from here on out. So get “comfortable” with the idea and deal with it. Medical science may sometimes alleviate some of the discomfort on some occasions, and simply “prolong the agony” in others, but it can’t change the future. We’ll all die if the Lord doesn’t come and get us first. With regard to disease and death, “it is what it is” and we have to just accept it. I’m not suggesting that we should forgo medical treatments– not all! I’m just saying that we have to recognize and accept their limitations, and stop endlessly worrying ourselves about that which is inevitable.       Illnesses and death give us opportunities. As mentioned above, they give us opportunities to come to a clearer understanding of our temporary status here ( cf. Phil.3:21 ). But illnesses and deaths within and among those who are brethren also provide us opportunities to “prove the sincerity of your (or in this case, our) love” for one another ( 2Cor.8:8 ). When I was so very ill with cancer, I became extremely emotional. The tears didn’t derive from the danger, or even the despair, of the disease, nor did they come from a fear of death. It was the tremendous outpouring of love and support from my brethren that produced them! It is truly a humbling, and at the same time an exalting, thing to really see, feel, and know the love that brethren have for one another when times get really tough. We all grow together as we love one another without hypocrisy , as we become genuinely devoted to one another , as we perform diligent acts of service to and for one another , as we contribute to the needs of one another , and as we rejoice and weep with one another as we face whatever triumphs and tribulations life throws in our paths. Illnesses and deaths, as well as other times of tremendous emotional strain, provide us the best opportunities to practice all of these things toward one another in the ways that Romans 12:9-15 describe. Such tragedies of life are inevitable– but be sure that our proper response to them in regard to ourselves or our brethren are just as sure to occur.       Illnesses and death are the doorway to eternity. It’s only natural that there be some fear associated with death because it is unknown. We know it will occur, and we try as we might to prepare for it in both physical and spiritual ways, but we don’t know exactly what death is like. Then too, we know death is sometimes painful. So, a part of us fears it. But what we have to keep remembering is that death is only the enemy of our spiritual selves  if we are unprepared. When we live lives of obedience to God and His word, death is simply the doorway to eternal reward. The necessity of death to attain our eternal reward is clearly taught by Paul in his letter to the Corinthians in 1Cor.15:36 , “...That which you sow does not come to life unless it dies”. So it is with us. We do not really come to life in the spiritual sense until our fleshly bodies die. It is true in nature with seeds, and it is true of us. Physical life is but the seed which produces the fruit of eternal reward only after it dies. It simply is the way it is– unless Christ gathers us first: we must all die to attain heaven . Christ suffered and died to be exalted forever again with the Father. So too must we. Death can be “graduation day” to eternal reward, if we study to show ourselves approved as workmen of God here and now in our physical lives.     Illnesses and deaths are never “pleasant” in the absolute sense. But they do teach us many valuable lessons, and provide us with many good opportunities, if we are spiritually minded about such things. “But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised. But he who is spiritual appraises all things….” ( 1Cor.2:14-15a ) How do y ou view illnesses and deaths? As the natural man who is willfully ignorant of God’s word, or as the spiritual man understands life, death, and eternal life through the Spirit’s revelation? Think about it. Better still, think about it, and then live it.    Illnesses and deaths are a necessary part of life– they teach of us of the importance and glory of heaven. As such they can’t be avoided. It’s the second death ( Rev.2:11 ) we need to worry about– and we don’t have to endure it.

We’re all aware of some “unwritten rule” - a dictum of some sort that supposedly most folks know and accept without the benefit of codification. These unwritten rules generally seem to be fairly logical to the average fellow and likewise usually expedient- if not altogether equitable. But they are still nonetheless unwritten . Have you ever wondered why such logical, expedient, and even equitable rules would remain unwritten ? With all of their benefits and near universal acceptance why would they not be official law? Surely there must be a reason. And there is.  What then prevents these unwritten rules from becoming codified law? One thing primarily- they are unwritten precisely because as such they serve a purpose that written rules or laws cannot serve. You see written rules are steadfast, unalterable, and must be unilaterally applied. They must be, since they are codified, fairly and universally applied to everyone equally. Such is the very nature of recorded rules.  But unwritten rules can be applied whenever it seems proper or suitable to us (or whoever applies them) and conveniently set aside when deemed less suitable or convenient by simply saying, “Well, it’s not like its graven in stone or anything!” No, it isn’t graven in stone or even written on paper for just such an occasion. Precisely!  That way, they do not  always have to be universally and fairly applied. What other explanation can there be? Why else would such “good” precepts not be made legal law through ratification? Surely there cannot be any other good reason to exclude them.  What has all of this to do with anything spiritual? Just this: God does treat all equally and fairly. Salvation is equally and fairly offered to everyone:    “For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone...”    Romans 1:16       “...God is now declaring to men that all everywhere should repent”   Acts 17:30       “and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His name to all the nations...”    Luke 24:47    You see God’s laws are intended to be fairly and universally applied to all people everywhere. Therefore they  are   codified . The rules are the same for everyone. All who believe and obey can be saved- without exception or partiality. Therefore God neither has, needs, nor utilizes any unwritten rules . His is laws instead are clearly and distinctly set forth for all to discern:     “that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. And by referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,”   Ephesians 3:3-4       “but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.”   John 20:31     God doesn’t need or use unwritten rules in Christianity. The things we must do to be pleasing to Him are clearly set forth in the New Testament. Therefore we should learn “not to exceed what is written in order that no one of you might become arrogant in behalf of one against the other”! ( 1Corinthians 4:6 ) Neither secret unwritten rules nor societies of men who profess to know and keep them– it’s all there plainly written in your New Testament for you to read, understand, obey, and live.

This spiritual forgetfulness can have some positive benefits, as well as some negative liabilities depending on the application .  On the positive side, having spiritual memory issues can be a good thing, especially when it comes to the ability to forget past failures and move forward toward future successes. Paul wrote to the Philippians regarding this very point, “…forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus,”  Philippians 3:13-14 . The great apostle would be the first to tell us (and he did so) that he had a lot in his past that he had to overcome. He was ever aware of his past rejection of Christ and persecution of the church, cf. 1Timothy 1:15 (he considered himself the foremost of sinners). So how could he both forget what lay behind and remember the magnitude of his past sins?  Paul never forgot that he had committed those sins, and even allowed them to motivate him to greater fidelity and service. But what he did forget was the guilt of those sins. He accepted the forgiveness of Christ, and was therefore able to forgive himself. Note 1Timothy 1:16 on this point, “And yet for this reason, I found mercy, in order that in me as the foremost (sinner) Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience, as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life.” He put into practice what we often fail to do: forgive ourselves by accepting the forgiveness of Christ when we meet His terms, and then forgetting the guilt of our sin!  But, there are also some negative aspects of “spiritual amnesia.” Consider the following carefully.    Hebrews 12:5-6  , “and having forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons, ‘My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when you are reproved by Him; for those whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives.” We sometimes forget that having God as our spiritual Father means that we occasionally need a good scourging! No one enjoys this kind of discipline from God, but if we forget that He does it for our good and because He loves us, we might either regard it lightly or faint- or rebel against it and Him, and quit even trying to do what it is right.    James 1:23-24  , “For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror; for once he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was.” There are a couple of things we need to understand from this passage to get the point. The mirror is God’s word- it shows us our natural face , which is a reflection of our faults. But if we look into this mirror and then go away from it and  forget  what we saw without making any corrections, we are just “hearers” rather than “doers” of God’s will. Remember, it is the “doers” of the word who are blessed of God, cf. v.25 !    2Peter 1:9  , “For he who lacks these qualities is blind or short-sighted, having forgotten his purification from his former sins.” Again, a few things must be brought into clear view to “see” Peter’s point. The qualities he has been urging to be added to our initial faith are listed in vv.5-7 . They must be increased and grown to produce usefulness, fruitfulness, and true knowledge,  v.8 . When we fail to add these qualities to our faith, Peter says that we become blind or short-sighted. This means that we will not be able to really “see” the truth any longer, and/or that we will not be able to see past the earthly and temporary things of this life to the spiritual and eternal goal of heaven. He also says it will cause memory loss with regard to our purification. Peter has specifically mentioned a couple of things that produce this purification: obedience to the word ( 1Peter 1:22 ), and baptism ( 1Peter 3:21 ). The point is that if we fail to grow and mature as Christians, we will forget that baptism is a birth that is supposed to be followed by growth, maturity, usefulness, fruitfulness, and true knowledge! Then, we will become apathetic, complacent, and may even quit!  While “spiritual amnesia” can be beneficial with regard to our former (forgiven) sins, it can also be very detrimental to our overall growth and development in the Cause of Christ and the pursuit of heaven!"],"title":["“Spiritual Amnesia”"],"_resultNumber":136,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/spiritual_amnesia","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":136},{"body":["It’s an ambitious question for an article of this size and scope. But in this day of extrapolations to the nth degree of everything, and seemingly endless “worst-case” scenarios, perhaps it is worthy of our consideration. Even the lawyer in Matthew 22:36 asked Jesus, “which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” Should we then assume that man’s greatest sin is a violation of God’s greatest commandment? Perhaps so, since Jesus answered the question with “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and will all your soul, and with all your mind.” Such has a myriad of general applications, the failure of which could certainly be “sinful.” But such things notwithstanding, what is man's worst sin?  But by what criterion would we judge one sin of man worse than all the others? First, we must know that sin is, by biblical definition, “missing the mark” of God’s word, 1John 3:4 . It is failing to do what God says. Second, we have to realize that any sin can cause us to lose our souls. God dispels our human concept of “big” vs. “little” sins in Matthew 5:21-22 when Jesus stated that one who issinfully angry with his brotheris viewed no differently at judgment than one who has committed murder. So when it comes to eternal consequences, any sin of which we will not repent has the capacity to cost us our souls (see also 1John 1:5 – 2:11 ). Can one sin then be worse than another?  Some sins affect more than just you. Consider our previous example. You can be sinfully angry with your brother and no one, including him, might even know, let alone be affected by it. However, if your anger caused you to harm him, or take his life, obviously he (and his family) is adversely affected. Your sin has now affected another. In fact, it could have detrimental effects on both the lives and eternal destinies of several others. Surely this sin must be judged “worse” than one which influences no one but you. Jesus made this application clear in Matthew 18:5-7 .  So, perhaps man’s worst sin is the one which is the most detrimental to the most people. Is it mass murder? Or perhaps actively opposing Christ and His teachings? Maybe, but let’s think a little closer to possible realities for you and me, who are ideally not mass murderers or the anti-Christ! Note carefully James 4:17 , “Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do, and does not do it, to him it is sin.” Now a question: Is it God’s will for Christians to tell others about salvation in Jesus Christ? Sure. “And the things you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.”  ( 2Timothy 2:2 ) Also, the “bearing much fruit” required in John 15:8 as proof of true discipleship means bringing others to Christ through sharing the gospel. True followers of Jesus thus take on His purpose to “seek and save” the lost, Luke 19:10 . When Christians who know this is the “right thing to do” fail to do so, isn’t it sinful? Read James 4:17 above again.  It gets worse: How many people do we come in contact with each day that are lost in sin, without God in their lives, and thus have no hope of eternal salvation? Doesn’t our selfish negligence of failing to share Jesus’ simple plan of salvation- “He who believes and is baptized shall be saved” ( Mark 16:16a ), constitute a detrimental effect on the lives of not only them, but also those whom they could in turn influence for truth and righteousness? It sure seems to meet the “worst sin” criteria as being the one which is the most detrimental to the most people! Is this then “man’s worst sin”? I don’t know, but it has to rank up there pretty close, don’t you think?  Consider one final point from 2Peter 3:9 . The text reads, “The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.” The “promise” of which the verse speaks is the destruction of the world and eternal judgment. But here’s my question: Who is the antecedent of the pronoun “you” in the verse? The verse says that the Lord, because He doesn’t want anyone to perish, is patient toward “you”- so who is the “you”? This second epistle of Peter is written to Christians, 2Peter 1:1-4ff . Thus, the verse is not saying that the Lord is being patient with the sinners; it is saying He is being patient with the saints! He is being patient with the saints that they might start doing what mature Christians are supposed to do: tell others of salvation in Jesus, and thereby spiritually reproduce! He is urging His own to stop committing what is perhaps man’s worst sin: not sharing the gospel. Wouldn’t this be the equivalent of failing to love the Lord with all your heart, soul, and mind like Jesus told the lawyer? Think about it carefully please, souls are at stake."],"title":["Man’s Worst Sin?"],"_resultNumber":137,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/mans_worst_sin","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":137},{"body":["“Yes,” that is an ambitious title. And “no” this one article does not contain everything we need to know to accomplish the objective. I always begin such topics with a disclaimer: I am not a psychologist, child-rearing expert, or certified counselor- I am a thirty-year preacher of God’s Word. While I don’t have “all the answers,” God’s Word does. I simply try to share what I’ve learned from it on the subject. That being said, this article will only scratch the surface of the topic, but will hopefully inspire you to look further into the only “Operator’s Manual” the Creator gave us for having, loving, and raising children.  Every godly parent hopes to be able to instill principles in their children that will insure eternal destiny for them. Unfortunately, the first inclination is often to seek advice from uninspired sources. It amazes me that folks who claim to believe in God will read every book written on raising children  except  the one written by the God who gave them the children in the first place! When 2Peter 1:3 says that “divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness,” why do we assume that raising children is somehow excluded? Do we really think that God is not wise enough to instruct us in this area also? Do we really think that so-called “experts” know more about child-rearing than the Creator of the Universe?  Adding further to the problem, many Christian parents think that raising godly children necessitates attending a large church with lots of other “good” children; or having their children heavily involved in church-related activities and programs; or attending a church with an effective Youth Minister. A survey published in Pulpit Helps years ago (I’ve long since forgotten the source) analyzed the faithfulness of “church-goers” and found that it was  not  a product of the size of the congregation attended; or the number of church-sponsored classes and special programs offered; or the effectiveness of the Youth Minister in the local congregation. Instead, the analysis revealed some very interesting statistics.   When both parents were faithful and active church members, 93% of their children remained faithful.  When only one parent was a faithful and active church member, the number dropped by twenty points to 73% .  When parents were only “reasonably active” (defined in the survey as attending church services, but otherwise uninvolved) the kids remained faithful only 53% of the time.  And when parents only attended church services infrequently, the children were faithful a mere 6% of the time.   What does this mean? First of all, it means that the typical things most Christian parents think are important to raising godly children really are not the most important factors. Instead, the most critical factor to raising godly children is the faithfulness and dedication of the parents themselves.  Put another way, the greatest influence on children’s spiritual well-being is the spiritual well-being of their parents. Did we really need survey statistics to learn this? Apparently. If you really want your children to grow up to be spiritual productive members of the Kingdom, be spiritual productive parents in the Kingdom! Children learn, value, and practice what they see valued and practiced by their parents. “Do as I say, not as I do” has never worked, and it never will.  The command of God is clear. Ephesians 6:4 , “Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger; but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.”  Dads, this is your responsibility- not your wife’s, or the church’s- yours. And the best first step to being the spiritual leader and provider for your family God requires of you is to be a faithful and dedicated Christian yourself. You cannot teach what you do not know. And if you attempt to teach to your family what you do not value and practice yourself, you will fail. Give it some thought, won’t you? The eternal destiny of you and your family hangs in the balance!"],"title":["Raising Godly Children"],"_resultNumber":138,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/raising_godly_children","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":138},{"body":["There are good reasons that the Bible warns of latter day prophets, but they may not be just the ones you suspect. If we believe the Bible’s claims of authority and completeness, ( see John 12:48; Ephesians 3:3-5; 2Timothy 3:16-17 ; et al ), then exactly what would a “modern” prophet tell us? If he “reveals” something different from the Bible, then either he or the Scripture is not true. If he “reveals” only what the Scripture has already said, he is not really a “prophet.”  I have no problem with anyone reading, understanding, and teaching the Word of God- that’s what we’re all supposed to do. “And the things which you have heard from me ( i.e. the Apostle Paul) in the presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.” ( 2Timothy 2:2 ). What I do have a big problem with is someone denying and contradicting the Word of God to promote themselves, or some pet theory or doctrine. It is far too easy for such a prognosticator to justify their claims with “God told me this.” How do I know God told you? How am I able to verify that you are truly speaking some new revealed truth? I don’t really consider myself either a skeptic or a cynic, but when the Word of God clearly says “But even though we ( i.e. inspired writers of the N.T.), or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to that which has been preached, let him be accursed” ( Galatians 1:8 ), then I’m going to believe God’s Word over some man/woman who contradicts it!  There are a few things we must realize with regard to modern day prophets. One, the Bible plainly gave the means to discern true vs. false prophets- “When a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord, if the thing does not come about or come true, that is the thing which the Lord has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously; you shall not be afraid of him.” ( Deuteronomy 18:22 ) Two, it is always our responsibility to test the words of men by the Word of God, Matthew 7:15-27 ; 1John 4:1-3 . And three, every so-called “prophet” who tries to convince you that God has given them some revelation in addition to or instead of the Bible is trying to avoid something that is in the Bible- and they want your money too! 2Peter 2:2-3 , “And many will follow their ( i.e. false prophets) sensuality, and because of them the way of truth will be maligned; and in their greed they will exploit you with false words…” Whatever point or doctrine they desire to propagate cannot be found in God’s Word. If it could be, what need would we have of them? We would just read God’s Word and get what we need. But if they can convince us that they have something else from God, then they have a niche market. Would Harold Camping have followers if everyone just understood and believed Matthew 24:44 ? God’s Word tells us all that we need to know to become “partakers of the divine nature,”  2Peter 1:3-4 .  If God gave us a standard, codified law, then we can eventually understand and either obey or disobey it. Penalties result if we choose to disobey, and rewards are graciously given for obedience. It may take considerable effort to come to that understanding, and legitimate differences of interpretation can be honorably debated, and the intent decided. But if “the law” keeps changing on the basis of “new revelations,” then the law really wasn’t adequate to begin with, was it? ( cf. Hebrews 7:18-19 ) Such is neither the character nor nature of Christ’s Law. “But the one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of liberty and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an effectual doer, this man shall be blessed in what he does.” ( James 1:25 ) Since 1Peter 1:22-25 tells us that Christ’s Law, which “purifies your souls” will “abide forever,” we really don’t need any modern prophets, do we? Just read, understand, and obey it, and God will take care of the rest!  One parting word of caution concerning modern prophets also seems to be in order. To me, the great danger of “end-time” prophecies that fail to materialize is that they promote the kind of false security of which 2Peter 3:1-4 warns. Despite the claims of “special revelation” false prophets, the truth of God’s Word still abides concerning the inevitable end of all things, see 2Peter 3:8-13 .

Whether in marriage, family, or just the kind of friendship that is as close as family, love and trust are the foundational components of the relationship. If love “makes the world go ‘round,” then trust allows us the security of being able to depend on its sustained revolutions. Obviously then, trust is just as vital as love to every significant relationship we sustain- perhaps even more so. Think about it….  Many people marry for “love,” and hope trust develops in the relationship. That’s backwards for a simple reason: You can decide and commit to loving someone whether they reciprocate it or not; but, trust demands their involvement in that they have to be trustworthy for you to believe and hope in them. Trust should, therefore, precede even love in the development of a relationship, because it is more dependent on the other person. Put in other words: You can decide to and learn to love someone whom you trust, but you cannot decide and learn to trust someone who is untrustworthy just because you love him/her- at least not without detrimental consequences. As a society, if we would consider marrying people we trust, and then choose and decide to love them, it would work out a lot better than trying to trust people just because we love them. But, the importance of trust and love in relationships is not limited to marriage. Trying to be close personal friends with someone you can’t or don’t trust likewise has disastrous consequences attached. And certainly, there are innumerable family relationships that are ruined because lies have destroyed the ability to trust, though love is still abundantly present. All of which proves that although love may indeed “make the world go ‘round,” trust has to be the axis on which it hangs and spins!  Now, all of that was somewhat of a foundational introduction to get to this: “Any close and personal relationship we hope to sustain with God must be founded and operated on the same basis of trust and love.” Though God certainly loved us when we were untrustworthy and unlovable,  cf. Romans 5:8 , our efforts to have a relationship with Him are founded in His eminent trustworthiness and magnanimous love for us. However, if God loved us but was not worthy of our trust, He wouldn’t be a good God, and we couldn’t depend on Him. Thankfully, such is not the case. Titus 1:2 and Hebrews 6:18 tells us that God “cannot lie,” and that in fact, it is “impossible” for Him to do so. Not only is it impossible for God to lie to us, He is utterly dependable with regard to every aspect of His love and provision for us- He wants and does nothing but what is best for us. He has given us “all things that pertain to life and godliness” to enable us to escape “the corruption that is in the world,”  2Peter 1:3- 4. He disciplines us “for our good, that we may share His holiness,”  Hebrews 12:10 . And, He even provides for our physical needs and wants by doing “good” and giving us “rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness,”  Acts 14:17 . All of which is lasting testimony to not only His love for us, but also to His complete trustworthiness!   But alas, relationships have two sides. What about our part of this “personal relationship” with God that is supposed to characterize our Christianity? Just saying that we “love God” isn’t any more sufficient grounds for this relationship than it was for any of the others we’ve considered. There has to be trust here also for a sustainable and pleasing relationship to exist. So, the big question becomes: “Can God trust y ou ?” Do you lie to God? Are you dependable and worthy of His trust? Certainly, none of us can hope to reciprocate God’s love and trustworthiness in equal measure- and I’m not even remotely suggesting such. But, the truth remains that if we desire a “close and personal relationship” with God, we must give diligence to fulfilling, as best we can, our responsibilities to the foundations of such a bond. This means we must not only love, but endeavor to be lovable- “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him, and make Our abode with him,”  John 15:23 . It also means that we must not only trust, but strive to be trustworthy- “be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life,”  Revelation 2:10 (KJV). Think about these things, and please make whatever changes are needed in your relationship with God.

What do all of these things have in common? They were all “left” in the pursuit of truth, salvation, and a right relationship with God.  In this pursuit of spiritual interests: Peter and Andrew left their nets (tools of trade), Matthew 4:18-20 ; James and John left their boat (fishing business), Matthew 4:21-22 ; the twelve disciples left their homes and families,  Matthew 19:27,29 , and farms,  Mark 10:29 ; Levi left a lucrative job (collecting taxes), Luke 5:27-28 ; the woman at the well left her water pot (immediate task), John 4:28 ; Abraham left his home, country, and family, Acts 7:3-4 ; and Paul left his personal freedom and safety, 2Corinthians 11:23-33 . All of which begs two important questions. 1) What have you left to follow Jesus? And, 2) What are you willing to leave to continue to follow Him?  In answer to the first question, “What have you left to follow Jesus”, many of us are extremely blessed in that we didn’t have to leave our families or jobs to become Christians. We were born into families that were believers, or were perhaps led to Christ by a boss or co-worker. We were likewise not required to leave our country, or even our personal freedom and safety. All we really had to leave were our sinful ways and habits- and these were actually hurting us anyway, Proverbs 13:15 (KJV).  But the second question- “What are you willing to leave to continue to follow Jesus?” is an entirely different matter. Jesus told a rich young ruler that he needed to \"go and sell your possessions and give to the poor….and follow Me,”  Matthew 19:21 . Jesus knew this man’s heart, and because He loved him ( Mark 10:21 ), told him what he needed, but did not want to hear. This story well-illustrates the principle that Jesus had previously relayed in Matthew 6:21 , “for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” The conclusion of the story is that instead of following Jesus as invited, the young man “went away grieved; for he was one who owned much property,”  Matthew 19:22 . The “owning” of the property wasn’t necessarily the problem. It was his trusting in and valuing the property more than he did a right relationship with Jesus that was problematic. But what about it- would Jesus say the same thing to us? And more importantly, would we feel and act the way this young man did, or more resemble the saints mentioned in Hebrews 10:34 ? That’s a tough question! How can we know the answer?  Since Jesus also said, “He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much” ( Luke 16:10 ), perhaps there are smaller indicators that will help us to know how we would react to such a requirement (and whether or not it is necessary for us!). Do we currently set aside our pursuit of spiritual things and a right relationship with Him for more selfish pursuits? Do we routinely set aside assembling with the saints to commemorate His death, worship, and learn more of His will for: recreational pursuits; time with our families; choosing to work; or other non-spiritual activities? There is certainly nothing wrong with any of these, unless we  prefer  and  choose  them over spending time worshiping and commemorating Jesus with His brethren. Isn’t that what “forsaking our own assembling together” means, cf. Hebrews 10:25 ?  There are times for all of us when “missing” services is required by an ox in the ditch/well , cf. Luke 14:5 . But, it is another matter entirely to lead that ox into the ditch, or push him into the well ourselves, and then to build a fence around him so he can’t get out to provide ourselves with a continual “excuse”! And yet, isn’t that exactly what we do when we willingly commit ourselves to activities that we know will require us to forsake the assembly? “Having to” miss worship is one thing- “volunteering” or “choosing” to do so is another matter entirely. If we “choose” to play, work, or visit instead of worship, are we really any different from those who “paid no attention and went their way, one to his own farm, another to his business” instead of attending the “wedding feast for his son” offered by the king in Matthew 22:5 ? Such sure sounds like our hearts are not in the right place.

And then, of course, there is “the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God ” in v.17 . So even though the word “soldier” is not present, there is no doubt that being a Christian is supposed to involve us in warfare- a fight against the “schemes of the devil,”  v.11 , and “world forces of darkness” and “spiritual forces of wickedness,”  v.12 ! But does it always? The answer depends on the individual soldier! For instance…   Are you  “4F”? This is the military designation given to those “not qualified for service in the Armed forces” because of “physical, mental, or moral” unfitness. Though physical fitness is not nearly as important in the Lord’s army as in Uncle Sam’s,  mental  and  moral  fitness are vital to the soldier of Christ! Intimate knowledge of the weapon itself, and its capabilities and limitations, is crucial to the proper use of the “sword of the Spirit, which the word of God”!  Hebrews 5:12 highlights the importance of good training with the sword in preparation of its proper use, “For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for some one to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God….”. Thus,  mental  fitness is important for the soldier of Christ- but, so too,  moral  fitness is required. Note 2Timothy 2:21 in this regard, “Therefore, if a man cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.” The “things” from which Paul urges us to cleanse ourselves are further clarified in the context as “wrangling about words,” “worldly and empty chatter,” “ungodliness,” “wickedness,” and “youthful lusts,”  vv.14,16,19,22 . Given these things, are you “4F,” or physically, mentally, and morally fit for service in the Lord’s army?   Are you  “AWOL”? This is the military designation for those who are “absent without leave.” It means they left their post and/or duties without permission to do so. This is a problem in the Lord’s army too! On a local level, the church is plagued by AWOL members who think nothing of absenting themselves for weeks at a time from the assembly, and its fellowship and duties, without a word to anyone. If questioned about it, they sometimes bristle and become indignant at the question, or pass it off with something along the lines of, “Oh, we’ve been really busy lately.” Can you image an infantryman explaining his being AWOL that way? No one is suggesting that local church members need some sort of advanced “permission” to be out of town for business or pleasure. But at the same time, shouldn’t members feel some sense of obligation to their local church families? What happens to our responsibilities to assemble with one another for worship, and to teach, admonish, and encourage one another when we choose to be AWOL for weeks at a time? Do we expect God and our brethren to just “suspend” our responsibilities because we prefer to be somewhere else doing something else? Please consider 1Corinthians 11:18-34 ; Ephesians 5:18-21 ; and Hebrews 10:19-25 in these regards.   Are you  “MIA”? This is the military designation for those who are “missing in action.” I suppose the correlation this case would be comparable to church member being away from his own “regiment” (local fellowship), but still working for the Cause. That is, he may not be with his own congregation, but he is assembling with and encouraging others wherever he is to be “strong in the faith.” Is this the attitude you have when away from home- to find brethren that you can help to strengthen and encourage with your presence and participation? Or, is it more along the lines of, “I’ll go somewhere for worship if it’s not too far and I’m not too busy or tired.”? The first one is MIA- the second is probably just AWOL!   Are you a  “POW”? This is the military designation for those who are “prisoners of war.” Unfortunately, in physical and spiritual wars, there are captives. There are some who, despite their efforts to “fight the enemy,” fall prey to them and become POWs. They become entangled in the defilements of the world and the affairs of this life and are overcome,  cf. 2Timothy 2:4 ; 2Peter 2:20 . In short, they are overrun by sin, Hebrews 12:2 , or caught/captured by trespasses,  Galatians 6:1 . Is this you? Are you a POW? If so, you’re supposed to have fellow soldiers out diligently searching for and rescuing you, Galatians 6:1ff ; Hebrews 12:12,13,15 !  What about it? Are you 4F, AWOL, MIA, or a POW ? Or, are you still a “hard-fighting soldier” in the Lord’s army?"],"title":["Are You 4F, AWOL, MIA, or a POW?"],"_resultNumber":142,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/are_you_4f_awol_mia_or_pow","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":142},{"body":["The so-called “Lord’s Prayer” really isn’t His. He taught and gave it to the disciples for their use, Matthew 6:5-9a (one of His prayers is recorded in John 17:1-26 , and is very different). The prayer is not a formula to be ritualistically recited,but it does contain a form that preaches as well as it petitions. For instance, note that the prayer includes:  · A  spiritual salutation  that recognizes and praises the greatness of God, v.9 ;  · A  spiritual plea  for God’s will and purposes to be done everywhere, v.10 ;  · A  physical petition  for only daily sustenance, v.11 ;  · A  spiritual supplication  for forgiveness that also requires us to think, feel, and act the way we would like God to think, feel, and act toward us, v.12 ; and,  · A  spiritual entreaty  for God’s protection and deliverance from temptation and evil, v.13 .  What’s missing in this prayer? Think about our own current prayers. Are they more like this model, or do they sound more like we’re presenting “our list” to some sort of celestial Santa Claus version of God? Are our petitions filled with physical requests for everything under the sun to make our life here the way “we” want it to be, or are they filled with spiritual requests for “God’s will” to be done in our lives, and only include the physical necessities of life? Which dominates our prayers: spiritual concerns and desires, or physical requests ?   Certainly we are to pray for, and recognize our dependence upon God for, physical things, Matthew 6:25-32 . But, doesn’t this passage also teach that spiritual concerns, needs, and requirements should dominate and come first, cf. vv.19-24, 33-34 ? So why don’t spiritual things comprise at least the majority of our thoughts, desires, and prayers (if indeed they don’t)? There are probably a number of reasons for this, and not all of them are necessarily indicting. Consider a couple of them.  1. We are physical creatures that, although we possess an immortal/eternal soul, live in a mortal/finite world. This is not an excuse; it’s just our current reality. But, it is a reality that has both a temporary escape and permanent end,  2Peter 2:4 ; 3:8-13 .  2. We are selfish. While upon the earth, everything Jesus Christ did was for us. He selflessly lived and died for us. If we are to truly be His disciples (followers), we must learn to pattern our lives after His selflessness and away from our own selfishness,  cf. Galatians 2:20 ; 6:14  . Simply put: We can live for self, or we can live for Him and others. An integral part of discipleship is self-denial,  Matthew 16:24 ; unfortunately for many of us, it is the most difficult part. And our prayer life reflects it. So, we wind up presenting “our” list to God in prayer of all the things “we” want and think would make our lives all that “we” want them to be. The consequence of these things is that “Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven” is rarely mentioned, and even less often really meant. It doesn’t have to be this way!  Let’s all decide to make 2014 different. Let’s acknowledge (and confess if need be) that:  1. God is God, and I’m not Him, Philippians 3:19 ;  2. He knows what is best for me and everyone else, and I do not, Isaiah 55:8-9 ;  3. His will is therefore better and more important than my will, Jeremiah 10:23 ; and so,  4. I will want and I will pray for His will to be done instead of mine, Matthew 6:10 .  Now, wouldn’t these things necessarily make 2014 a better year? I think so. Let’s give them a try, and be sure to include “Thy will be done, on earth (and in my life) as it is in heaven” in our thoughts and prayers- and let’s mean it too!"],"title":["Whose Will Will It Be For 2014?"],"_resultNumber":143,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/whose_will_will_it_be_for_2014","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":143},{"body":["What we usually refer to as “common knowledge” is often “common” (shared), but is rarely “knowledge” (true/factual). Perhaps this is nowhere more evident than in regard to “common knowledge” of the Scriptures. Perhaps a few examples will help to illustrate the point. Many have said or believed such “common knowledge” precepts as…   “Cleanliness is next to godliness.” I suspect this was first introduced by, and rapidly became “common knowledge” to, mothers who struggled to keep their families clean. However, this well-known adage is not in the Scriptures (sorry moms!). Perhaps the closest biblical text dealing with this issue can be found in Matthew 15:1-20 . Here, Pharisees (a hypocritical and self-righteous sect of the Jews during Christ’s time) accused Jesus’ disciples of violating God’s Law because they ate with unwashed hands, v.2 . Rather than condemning His disciples, Jesus instead indicts the Pharisees for adding their own requirement to God’s Law (since God never said it). He went on to say that spiritual defilement didn’t come from such external things, but the internal uncleanness of the heart, vv.17-20 . Given that God’s thoughts and ways are much higher than our own, cf. Isaiah 55:8-9 , we should all pay attention to what God has actually said, and stop adding to it or taking from it, Revelation 22:18-19 .   “If we would just keep the Ten Commandments, everything would be better and we could all go to heaven.” What do the Scriptures actually say? The Ten Commandments were given to Jewish people (direct physical descendants of Abraham) living in the time period between the giving of the Law of Moses at Mt. Sinai and the cross of Jesus, cf. Exodus 19:1-8 and Hebrews 9:15-17 . Though most of the Ten Commandments are repeated in, and thus made a part of, the Law of Christ (New Testament), the Law of Moses (Old Testament) was actually only given to the nation of Israel living during that time period. In fact, Jewish Christians in the region of Galatia who tried to appeal to the Law of Moses were told they had “fallen from grace,”  Galatians 5:4 . So, we can’t “go to heaven by keeping the Ten Commandments.” God invested His power to save in the gospel of Jesus Christ, Romans 1:16 , not the Ten Commandments.   “The truth shall set you free.” This is often quoted in a multitude of circumstances, but is probably not true in most applications typically implied. Although the quote does come from the Bible, this is not all of it. The full sentence of Jesus, recorded in John 8:31-32 , is, “If you abide in My word, then are you truly disciples of Mine; and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.” The “freedom” of which Jesus spoke is spiritual freedom from the consequences of eternal damnation, not the various applications usually made. Furthermore, this spiritual freedom was not based solely on the truth itself. Jesus began the sentence with “if”. The truth only sets us free “if” we meet the conditions stated in the rest of the sentence. Note that Jesus said one must: “ abide in My word” (be obedient to it), and thus become a “ disciple ” of His(follower, a Christian), by “ know (ing) the truth” (can’t obey or follow without knowledge) in order to be made “free” by the truth. So the “truth” that makes one “free” is the “word” of Jesus that is “known” and “obeyed” and “followed”! Anything less doesn’t result in spiritual freedom.   “Jesus is the reason for the season.” The birth of Jesus was certainly a momentous event in human history. Do you really know why? God is eternal and thus cannot die. Since God planned and desired to “give His only begotten Son” to shed His bloodas a sacrifice for our sin, Jesus would need a human body- one that could die, Ephesians 1:3-7 . Thus, Jesus became God incarnate (in the flesh), Colossians 2:9 . So far, so good- but, despite being “common knowledge” that Jesus was born on December 25 th , and that we’re supposed to celebrate Christmas to remember and honor His birth, the Bible does not say either of these things. God knows how to tell time and read a calendar, but chose not to reveal the date of Jesus’ birth. And, neither God nor Jesus, or the Holy Spirit-inspired writers of the New Testament, ever intimated that Christians should memorialize Christ’s birth. However, we are told to memorialize His death, which His birth obviously enabled, Matthew 26:26-29 . This N.T. Christians did on the first day of every week as the Jesus and the Holy Spirit taught, Acts 20:7 ; 1Corinthians 11:18-34 .  There is nothing necessarily wrong with cleanliness, the Ten Commandments, the freedom that truth provides, or the celebration of “Christmas,” but let’s remember to read and practice what the Bible actually says, in the way that it says, rather than depending on “common knowledge,” OK?"],"title":["“Common Knowledge” and the Scriptures"],"_resultNumber":144,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/common_knowledge_and_the_scriptures","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":144},{"body":["Bro. Dean Bullock (aka “the Beloved” and “Judge” by some) passed away this past week. I suppose I knew him just about all of my life- like so many other church folks throughout East Texas, and across the state and country. Perhaps as much as anyone else, Dean was responsible for me becoming a “preacher,” at least to the degree that such has occurred. So, now you know whom to blame! More seriously, he was my preacher (while he did local work in the congregation where I grew up), my teacher (while I worked and studied with him in Lufkin), my “agent” (for years he would call me every two or three years to see if I wanted to move to some other “good work” he knew about), my father in the faith (as he showed me what a “preacher” was and did) my brother in Christ (which is most important of all), and my friend (who I will always cherish). But this isn’t going to be tearful recitation of this noble servant’s life. Dean had a great, and very dry, sense of humor. So, let me relay one of his favorite stories, and hopefully make an appropriate point from it.  Dean proudly hailed from the tiny town of Alto, Texas. When he was young, he joined the Navy. Some of his favorite “tales” came from those younger years in Alto, or his time in the Navy. He loved to tell about one of his buddies from Alto who was also in the service (I never knew whether this “buddy” was real or fictitious). This friend asked a passing serviceman, “Hey buddy, whereya from?” The man replied proudly, “I’m from New York city!” Dean’s friend answered quite matter-of-factly, “Is that right?” “Yes sir,” the man responded, “Where are you from?” Dean’s friend immediately stood, poked out his chest as far as he could, and said with great pride, “I’m from Alto Texas!” “Really?” the passerby asked, “I’ve heard of Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and Corpus, but I don’t think I’ve ever heard of Alto.” “Oh, that’s OK,” Dean’s friend said slyly, looking down and kind of kicking at the ground while also peeking back with one eye, “There’s folks in Alto that have never heard of New York city!” (Apologies are hereby tendered to the current residents of Alto, all of which I’m certain know of New York, and some of which have been there.)  Hometown pride is a good thing, but just about every hometown has its good points and its not-so-good points. Hopefully, we can have the good nature to accept these things, and joke about and overcome them as necessary. Most of us are proud of “where we came from” regardless of whatever shortcomings it may have. And many of us, no matter where we’ve been, what we’ve done, and how we’ve lived, want to return “home” at the end of our lives- whether to live out our remaining days, or to “rest” until the Lord’s final call. But for the faithful Christian, things are a little bit different…  “Home” or “hometown” for the Christian means something different, something more- much more. Christians understand heaven to be their “hometown,” though they’ve never been there, except in the mind and eternal presence of God. They long to go “home” to that city from which they spiritually originate. They long to go “home” to be with their spiritual Parent, Brother, and family. Earthly ties of friends, family, and places are strong, but pale in comparison to the desire to go “home.” The swelling pride of their eternal “hometown” of heaven is not arrogant or boastful, but is an ever-present, sweet, and earnest longing. Philippians 3:20-21 , “For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ; who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.”   We can all be proud of our physical hometowns - regardless of their grandeur or humbleness, but Christians should be proud (in a good way) of our spiritual hometown of heaven; and more than anything else, long to go there. I will surely miss my friend, but I can’t mourn for the Beloved, he’s simply gone “home” to the place he longed to be much more than even his beloved Alto.

I promised then to try to make amends by returning the favor on Father’s Day. So in an effort to be true to my word, and give proper recognition to the ladies….    The quotation in our title is taken from Luke 24:22 in the English Standard Version. After the resurrection of Jesus, but before His appearance to the Twelve, He was walking along with Cleopas and another disciple (who was unnamed by the sacred text) toward the village of Emmaus. Jesus began conversing with these two men regarding their perspective of the recent events in Jerusalem– but He did so without them knowing who He was. They told of the crucifixion which had seemingly dashed their hopes for the redemption of Israel. Then they said, “But also some women among us amazed us.” (NASV) The amazement that came from these women stemmed from their report that Jesus was not in the tomb, but was indeed alive!    Women had played a prominent role in the life and ministry of Jesus. Matthew , Mark , and Luke all record how there were several women who ministered to Jesus (and undoubtedly those traveling with Him) while He ministered to the people, cf. Matt.27:55 ; Mark 15:41 ; and Luke 8:1-3 . Luke even records that they contributed to this support “out of their private means.” Isn’t that the way good and godly women have always acted? They labor and strive and serve themselves but also seem to find a little “extra” money to contribute to a worthy cause from what used to be called the “butter and egg” money. With what amazing creatures the divine Creator has blessed us! Surely, that being called “woman” was and is the crown-jewel of all God’s creation.    But women haven’t only served the Lord’s Cause by feeding, tending, and contributing funds. Not at all. If you care to scan through the great “Hall of Faith” and heroism in Hebrews 11 , right along with the names of Abel, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham you’ll find Sarah ( v.11 ), Rahab ( v.31 ), and the “Women” who “received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, in order that they might obtain a better resurrection…” ( vv.35ff ). Likewise, Paul singles out Phoebe as a “servant of the church which is at Cenchrea” ( Rom.16:1 ), and Euodia and Syntyche as “women who have shared my struggle in the cause of the gospel, together with Clement also….whose names are in the book of life.” ( Phil.4:3 ) In so many places where Paul tried to spread the gospel, it was the women who were first responsive to it, and then responsible for its further acceptance. Such was certainly the case in Philippi with Lydia and the women there who had gathered by the river to pray, cf. Acts 16:13ff .    And certainly, no discussion of the important role women have played in the development of the gospel story would be complete without mentioning Mary , the chaste virgin chosen to be the mother of our Lord. Likewise, it would be remiss not to mention also Eunice and Lois , the mother and grandmother of Timothy– whose faith was first instilled in him by these fine examples of Christian motherhood ( 2Tim.1:5 ; Acts 16:1ff ).    One more thing while I’m on the subject. Have you ever noticed that in virtually every church there are more women than men. Sure, some of this disparity is due to women generally living longer than men. But even among the younger crowd, usually there are more women in the congregation. And do you know why? Women are generally more receptive to and faithful in the gospel, that’s why! They do a better job of humbling themselves to the gospel’s call and obeying its requirements.    So, while we celebrate “fatherhood” today in our culture, let us never forget that is the women of our company that amaze us . No man is truly “self-made”. He likely has a woman to thank who has gently molded and sternly scolded him into whatever greatness he has achieved. Never forget that it was Adam who was deemed incomplete alone by the Creator!

Is reciting “the sinner’s prayer” what God requires of us for salvation? As always, the answers are to be found not by making sweeping declarations, but by examining what the Bible actually says. What I, or any man, thinks, preaches, or teaches carries no weight whatsoever unless the Word of God confirms it. So, let’s take a look….  There is no New Testament passage that instructs an alien sinner to simply pray for salvation, but there are four important examples that need to be considered- and each one has a vital lesson to be learned.  The first occurs in Acts 2 , on the occasion of the first gospel preaching done publically after Jesus’ death, burial, resurrection, and ascension. The crowd on Pentecost, through the sermon by Peter and the other apostles, became convicted of their sin(s) of having crucified Jesus. They asked, “Men and brethren, what shall we do?” They didn’t ask what to feel, or even experience, but what to  do   , understanding that salvation required activity on their part. Were they told to say “the sinner’s prayer,” or “accept Jesus into their hearts”? No, they were told to “Repent and be baptized for the remission of your sins…”  Acts 2:38 .  Secondly, consider Simon in Acts 8 . He was definitely told to “pray the Lord that, if possible, the intention of your heart might be forgiven you” in the last part of v.22 . But there are a couple of vital considerations here also. In the first part of the verse, he was told to “repent of this wickedness of yours and pray....”. So, praying wasn’t the only thing required. However, it should also be noted that Simon had already been saved by belief and baptism, just like the rest of the Samaritans, vv.12-13 . Peter’s command for him to pray for forgiveness was as a fallen Christian coming back to Christ, not a sinner coming to Christ for the first time.  The third important example related to “praying for salvation” is found in Acts 10 . It is obvious that Cornelius was a “devout man, and who feared God...and prayed to God continually,”  v.2 . For what was he praying? While we are not told specifically, the object of his petitions becomes apparent from the response of God to them. In v.4 he was told by God’s messenger, “Your prayers and alms have ascended as a memorial before God.” Then he was told to send for Peter. Why? Cornelius was devout, benevolent, and prayerful already- wasn’t this enough for salvation? Evidently not, for when Peter arrived, the text says, “He ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,”  v.48 . Cornelius, a believer, was evidently praying for salvation (undoubtedly among other things also), so God sent Peter to him that he might obey that which was still lacking: his baptism in Jesus Christ.  And finally, Saul of Tarsus is the fourth of our examples. Saul had been a persecutor of Jesus and the church, Acts 9:1-2,5 . Then Jesus appeared to him on the road to Damascus, vv.3-5 . But note carefully the words of Jesus to him in v.6 , “but arise, and enter the city, and it shall be told you what you must do.” Having this great personal experience with the King of kings, and even conversing with Him directly, did not fulfill Saul’s spiritual need with regard to salvation. So, he got up and went into Damascus as instructed, and spent three days and nights fasting and  praying   ,  vv.9,11 . Did this praying remit his sins and provide salvation? When God’s messenger Ananias arrived to tell Saul what he must do, what did he instruct? Notice the testimony of Paul (the Greek equivalent of “Saul”) on this point from Acts 22:16 when he recounts what God’s messenger told him, “And now why do you delay? Arise, and be baptized , and wash away your sins, calling on His name.” Ananias did not tell Paul to pray for salvation- he told him to be  baptized  for salvation. Though Paul had seen and conversed with the Lord personally, and now, as a believer in Jesus, had spent three days fasting and praying, he was told to be baptized to “wash away his sins.”   I realize that many today are told to “Pray the Sinner’s Prayer” or “Accept/Invite Jesus into your heart” to be saved, I just can’t find anyone in the New Testament who was told to do that. What I do find is that in every case of conversion in the book of Acts , three things occurred each time to produce salvation: 1) the gospel was preached; 2) the respondents believed; and 3) they were baptized for the remission of sins.

Beside Him was the cross of Rebellion on which hung a robber who railed and mocked Jesus even as they both suffered the agonies of death. But on the other side of Christ was a man who, though also a robber ( Mark 15:27 NASV, Romans did not typically crucify petty thieves; the word probably indicates violence, cp. Luke 10:30 ), turned his cross into one of repentance. When his cohort in crime castigated Jesus, he defended the Messiah while confessing his sin, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong,”  Luke 23:41 . And then his heart of repentance was manifested when he turned to Jesus and said, “Jesus, remember me when you come in Your kingdom!” Where and when this thief had come to knowledge of and subsequent faith in Jesus and His kingdom is not specified- but he obviously possessed them both. Thus, his knowledge, faith, confession, and repentance prompted Jesus to utter those blessed words, “Today you shall be with me in Paradise.”   Many today hang their hopes of salvation on this wonderful example of repentance. They want to be saved “just like the thief on the cross.” By this they usually mean without baptism, or any other “work” of salvation. But there is a problem with this desire- actually a few of them. Please consider the following.   1. Jurisdiction. The “thief on the cross” lived under the jurisdiction of the Law given at Mt. Sinai- the Law of Moses. It was God’s law for the Jewish people only ( Exodus 20:2,22; 24:1-18 ) from that time until Christ’s Law (the Gospel) became effective after His death, Romans 7:1-7 ; Colossians 2:14 . This law of God did not require baptism, thus Jesus did not require baptism of him for salvation.   2. Chronology. During His life, Jesus had taught the essentiality of baptism for salvation, cf. John 3:3-5 . This, like all other parts of His Law- the gospel, were taught in preparation for the time they would become of force. But, He did not issue the command requiring everyone to believe andbe baptized until after His death, burial, and resurrection, Mark 16:9-16 . The Hebrews writer makes it clear that Jesus’ law, His testament , became effective only after His death, Heb.9:16-17ff . Therefore, Christ’s command for all to believe and be baptized for salvation did not become “law” until the inception of His kingdom and law after His death (on the day of Pentecost, Acts 2 ). Thus , the thief on the cross died roughly fifty days before Christ’s law requiring baptism became effective.   3. Elements. Most everyone who wants to be saved “just like the thief on the cross,” in addition to not being aware of the two points above, have not considered exactly what all was entailed in this man’s salvation. He had  knowledge  of who and what Jesus was, otherwise he would not have appealed to Him for salvation, John 8:24 . He had  faith  (which is always based on knowledge from God, cf. Romans 10:17 ) that Jesus had the ability to provide his petition otherwise he would not have appealed to Him, Hebrew 11:6 . He  confessed  his own sin and the rightfulness of his punishment, as well as Jesus’ future position as King, otherwise he would not have appealed to Him, Romans 10:9-10 . He  defended  Jesus to others in obviously difficult circumstances, Matthew 10:32-33 . But, and don’t overlook this one, he also was  literally  and  agonizingly crucified for his sins!    Under Christ’s law, the crucifixion of the flesh is accomplished by putting to death our “old self” by being “buried with Christ” through baptism that we might rise to walk a resurrected life, Romans 6:3-7 . This method, and not to put too fine a point on it, is much better than being nailed to cross, hung up in the sun for all the world to see and ridicule, and having your legs broken after several hours of horrific pain so that you suffocated to death! Now, are you sure you still want to be saved “like the thief on the cross”? Or, wouldn’t you rather just believe and be baptized like Christ commanded?"],"title":["Being Saved “Like the Thief on the Cross”"],"_resultNumber":149,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/being_saved_like_the_thief_on_the_cross","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":149},{"body":["Give a listen to what Jesus had to say about Hell in Mark 9:43,48 , “the unquenchable fire…where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.” Likewise, the rich man of Luke 16:19-24ff said of Hades (which is not Hell proper [Gehenna] but is getting real close), “I am in agony in this flame.” We don’t necessarily like to talk about Hell, but the Bible surely does!  We don’t necessarily like to talk about Hell, but the Bible surely does. Just because it is uncomfortable for us to consider the possibility of an eternity in “unquenchable fire” does not alter its reality. Hell is a very real place. We find many biblical descriptions of it, just like we do of Heaven. So if we believe in Heaven, we necessarily also believe in Hell because our knowledge of both comes from the same Bible.  The Sacred Text gives some insight into the nature of Hell, but think for a moment about some of the “comforts of home” here that won’t be found in Hell .  In Hell there aren’t any flashlights. That doesn’t sound so awful. But consider that at least three times ( Matt.8:12; 22:13; 25:30ff ) Jesus described Hell as a place of “outer darkness.” With this phrase He gives us the image of farthest out darkness- where there is “weeping and gnashing of teeth.” Think of experiencing this without even a flashlight to reveal where such horrors might be lurking.  In Hell there isn’t any water. Water is something we take for granted every day. We just turn on the tap and expect it to stream forth sustenance, cleanliness, and the ability to “cool off.” But in Hell there is no water. Remember the rich man in torment that Jesus told us about in Luke 16 ? He asked that Lazarus might “dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue; for I am in agony in this flame.” ( v.24 ) If even a small drop of water on your tongue is seen as comfort to your agony, that’s a lot of agony! But there was not even a drop of water to be found in the torment of Hades.  In Hell there aren’t any fences. Again, at first this doesn’t sound so bad. But think about it. We use fences to keep what we want in, or what we don’t want out. In Hell, we won’t have anything we necessarily desire to keep in, but there will sure be a lot of things we would love to keep out! Think of all of the evil that has existed throughout human history that will be in Hell ( cf. 1Corinthians 6:9-10; Revelation 21:8 ). Think of all the evil spirits that will be banished to Hell along with Satan. Think also of all the misery the Bible attributes to Hell. All of these will be there without a single fence to keep them away.  In Hell there isn’t any hope. Human beings can endure untold horrors if we have hope that there is some future end of them. Revelaton 20:10 speaks of the hopelessness of those committed to Hell as being “tormented day and night forever and ever.” It may be comforting to think of Hell as a “cessation of being,” as some folks do, but unfortunately that is just not true according to the Bible. Perhaps the greatest horror of Hell is that it has no end. Therefore it allows no hope of relief or extrication.  In case you haven’t noticed yet, the main reason that Hell is so horrible is the  absence of God!  Physical death is the separation of the man’s body from his spirit, James 2:26 . But spiritual death is the separation of man’s spirit from God. Matthew 25:41 says, “ Depart from Me , accursed ones, into the eternal fire…”  2Thessalonians 1:9 adds, “And these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,”. It is the complete and permanent absence of God that makes Hell horrific!  But mercifully, there is an alternative. “Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city.” The “city” is heaven. If we, in faith, “wash our robes” in the blood of Jesus by baptism, Acts 2:38; 22:16; 1Corinthians 6:11 , and, in faith, live for Him rather than ourselves, we avoid the horrors of Hell and are instead graciously allowed to spend eternity with God in Heaven! Otherwise, the reality of Hell awaits: “Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the immoral persons and the murders and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying.”  Revelation 22:15"],"title":["If You Think It’s Hot in East Texas…"],"_resultNumber":150,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/if_you_think_its_hot_in_east_texas","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":150},{"body":["I confess some lack of understanding how some people can claim to believe in the eternal reward of heaven, but not in the reality of an eternal punishment in hell. Doesn’t the same Bible that tells of one also describe the other?  While it may be somewhat comforting to think that if we don’t want to “go to all the trouble” of doing what God says to attain eternal reward, that we can live as we want now and then just cease to exist at death, the Bible just doesn’t provide that option. Note 2Corinthians 5:10 in this regard, “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done , whether good or bad .” There simply is no “middle ground” here, for the Savior also said, “He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me, scatters,”  Matthew 12:30 . So, it is really up to us- God has done His part by graciously providing not only the  means  of salvation through the sacrifice of His Son, He also supplied the  instructions  on how to appropriate that redemptive price of Jesus’ blood, Titus 2:11-14 .  There are two great motivators in life:  love  and  fear.  God used  love  in that He showed us how much He loved us through the sacrifice of His Son, Romans 5:8 , in hopes that we would lovingly reciprocate by sacrificing our lives in faith and devotion to Him, Colossians 3:1-14 . But He also used  fear  to motivate us to do the right things; specifically, the fear of eternal punishment in hell. Note Jesus’ words of warning from Matthew 13:42 , “and they will cast them ( stumbling-blocks and lawless, from the previous verse) into the furnace of fire; in that place there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” In Mark 9:48 , Jesus further described hell as a place “where the worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.” If the notion of an eternal punishment composed of fire, worms, and pain sufficient to cause one to bite at himself and others like a wild animal doesn’t instill a healthy fear in you, well, then you may need to re-evaluate things!  But in all of the descriptions that are given of hell in the Text (see also Revelation 20:10 ; e.g. ), the things absent also arrest my attention. Note a few of them.  1) There is no  water  in hell. With all that fire, there is not a drop of water to be found. Do you remember how the “rich man” (of Luke 16 ) begged for even a drop of water “to cool my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame” in v.24 ? There is no relief in hell.  2) There are no  flashlights  in hell. When a storm causes a power outage, one of the first things we want is a flashlight. But hell is described as a place of “outer darkness,”  Matthew 25:30 . There is no way to see in hell.  3) There are no  fences  in hell. We use fences to either keep things in, or to keep things out. In hell, there will be no desire to keep what we have in, but there won’t be any way to keep the other bad things out either! Since inhabitants of hell will be sharing the abode with those cataloged in 1Corinthians 6:9-11 and Revelation 21:8; 22:15 , a fence would be a useful, but unavailable, commodity.  4) There is no hope in hell. We humans have been endowed with the ability to endure tremendous hardship and even torture, provided we can see an end or purpose to it. But with the eternal nature of hell (see Revelation 20:10 again), such a hope of relief or release is dashed. Instead, hope is replaced with eternal contemplation and regret for opportunities forfeited. Part of the punishment for the “rich man” of Luke 16 was an eternity to “remember,”  v.25 !  5) There is no God in hell. If we haven’t figured it out by now, the absence of God is what makes this place of torment “hell”! Physical death is the separation of the body and spirit, James 2:26 , but spiritual death, which is “the second death” of Revelation 20:14 , is the subsequent separation of the unrighteous spirit from God for eternity, Matthew 25:41 !  Please understand that our gracious and loving God doesn’t want anyone to spend eternity in hell, 1Timothy 2:4 , and has provided the opportunity for us to avoid it, but such does not change the reality of its existence, horrors, or inhabitants, Matthew 25:41 ."],"title":["The Realities of Hell"],"_resultNumber":151,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/the_realities_of_hell","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":151},{"body":["Our society, in general, has become very tolerant - perhaps too much so. Generally, “tolerance”is an attitude of sympathy or indulgence toward opposing views. It necessarily also includes patience, forbearance, endurance, and longsuffering. The New Testament certainly requires all who would be godly to be patient, kind, and tolerant of views and practices they do not share ,  cf. Romans 14:1 – 15:3 . But possessing and cultivating a spirit of forbearance is something very different from encouraging and allowing the lines between “right” and “wrong” to be altered!  Some 750 years before the time of Christ, God’s prophet Isaiah pronounced a woe (curse) upon those who would “call evil good and, and good evil; who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness; who substitute bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and clever in their own sight.” ( Isaiah 5:20-21 ) Being tolerant and forbearing with someone who may have differing opinions regarding matters of indifference with God, as Romans 14-15 is discussing, is a far cry from calling something God said was “evil,” “good.” Folks attempting to be godly (literally , god-like ; meaning we try to think , feel , and act like God) are expected to be tolerant of indifferent matters of personal judgments, but are neither required nor allowed to tolerate sin.  The church at Corinth was condemned because it tolerated sin. Paul said “that someone has his father’s wife”- obviously indicating a sexually immoral association, v.1 . Evidently the church there had become very broad-minded and tolerant in their views of what God had called “evil.” They were also charged with arrogance regarding this situation, v.2 . Perhaps this means they were foolishly proud of their “tolerance.” He said they should have “mourned instead” for the sin, and “removed (the guilty man) from your midst.” On down in the text, he added, “I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he should be an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler…”  v.11 , but to instead, “remove the wicked man from among yourselves”  v.13 . Now, does that sound “tolerant” to you? Me neither!  Furthermore, the church at Thyatira was specifically condemned for its tolerance of one who claimed to speak for God, but had led others into immorality, idolatry, and adultery,  Revelation 2:20ff . Remember, Jesus said in Matthew 7:16a , “You shall know them (false prophets) by their fruits.” If someone claims to speak for God, and yet their teaching/doctrine leads to practices that God calls “sin”- such as sexual immorality, idolatry, and adultery, then surely they should  not  be tolerated! God said He would “cast her (the false teacher in this case) upon a bed of sickness, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation…And will kill her children with pestilence…”  Revelation 2:22-23 . If we want to be godly, which is again, god-like, we cannot tolerate what God refuses to tolerate!  Our society has coerced well-meaning and good-intentioned people into tolerating , then accepting , and ultimately even legitimizing sexual immoralities that God calls “evil.” As society in general has become more tolerant of these sinful practices- such as fornication, adultery, and homosexuality, churches have been influenced to become increasingly more tolerant of them also. Folks, as Peter said in Acts 5:29 , “we must obey God rather than men”! God-like people are patient, kind, forbearing, long-suffering, toward all; and even tolerant of judgments and practices that differ from their own- provided they are not sinful. But God’s people will not, and cannot, tolerate teaching and practices that God calls “evil”- at least not and remain God’s people! That’s not being unkind or judgmental, it is simply “speaking where God has spoken,” 1Peter 4:11 ."],"title":["Is “Tolerance” a Modern Virtue or a Fatal Flaw?"],"_resultNumber":152,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/is_tolerance_a_modern_virtue_or_a_fatal_flaw","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":152},{"body":["Last week a fine young man asked me for some help with “homework” for one of his college medical classes.

Strangely, God’s word had been telling me the same things for years, but perhaps I wasn’t quite listening- maybe you will.

And if that is what they learned from being seriously ill, then they still don’t get it. Being faced with your own mortality should make you understand that “this life” is not the most important thing. It can’t be when compared to eternity. I feel sorry for people who don’t believe in life after death as the Bible teaches. They have to try to cram all of what they call “living” into a few years of earthly existence- and usually make themselves and everyone around them miserable in the process. But understanding that “this life” is not only not all there is, but also that it is not even the best part of us, is essential information to emancipated living. God said, “but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven…for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” ( Matthew 6:20-21 ) As long as we make “this life” our priority, we will never really learn how to live it.     You’re not really “ready to die” unless you’re OK with dying toda y. Living in such a way as to be “ready to die” is a noble goal. But the reality is that even those who think that’s what they’re doing probably aren’t. Most of us epitomize the old song line by wishing to be “too old to die young.” We’d love to be able to say, like Paul, “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith” when our time comes, but never dream of saying it today! Death is something we prepare for doing when we finally get tired of living- sometime way, way, way on down the line. We really don’t get to choose, but what if you could? If the option was somehow given you to either depart this life today to be with God forever in heaven, or live out the rest of your days on earth and then take your chances at judgment, which would you pick? “He who hesitates is lost.” From one who’s been there, if you’re not OK with dying toda y, then you really haven’t really learned how to live.     Death is not the enemy. Death only becomes a bad thing when Satan and sin have controlled the life. We hear Revelation 13:14 at funerals, but never seem to apply it ourselves: “Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.” Take that personally. Your death will be a “good thing” if you are “in the Lord.” Only when one lives subject to Satan and sin is death a true tragedy. But for those who live subject to Christ and righteousness, death is “graduation day.” It is the “rest from their labors” of which John wrote. It is the doorway to eternal reward and happiness. Death is only the enemy of those who have invested everything in physical, rather than spiritual, life.

Now I realize, and I’m sure you do also, that God does not suffer the memory lapses that cause us to have to write things down to prevent forgetting them! God is omniscient (all-knowing), and thus does not have such human maladies with which to contend. So, why is there this book?  The best answer is probably that accommodative language is being used to help our understanding. Heaven is a spiritual place, and thus is not literally composed of physical things like streets of gold, seas like glass, and jeweled gates - or books. All of these images are utilized to convey a spiritual place to physical minds.  But let’s get back to God’s “book.” Daniel 12:1 speaks of “the book” in whose names are recorded those who would be rescued from distress. Jesus, in Luke 10:20 , indicates that His disciples ought to rejoice that “your names are recorded (presumably in this “book” ) in heaven.” In Philippians 4:3 , Paul mentions some specific women “whose names are recorded in the book of life.”  Revelation 13:8 adds that it has been “written from the foundation of the world…” and 21:27 clearly says that “only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life” will enter heaven.  These things beg two essential questions. First, “How does one come to have their name recorded in God’s ‘book of life’?” Let’s answer this one by looking at Jesus’ last words to the Twelve, whom He was sending out into the world to preach the gospel to all men that they might be saved, “Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching themto observe  all that I commanded you…”  Matthew 28:19-20 . That seems pretty clear! If we want to have our names recorded in “the book of life” so that we can enter and spend eternity in heaven, we must become  “disciples”  (literally, followers ) of Christ by being  “baptized”  (immersed)  “in the name of”  (by the authority of) the  “Father, Son, and Holy Spirit”  (the three ‘personages’ of Deity: Planner, Savior, and Revealer) and  “observe all that I commanded”  (do what the New Testament says). By the grace of God, this enrolls our names in His “book of life,” Hebrews 12:23 !  The second question this whole “book of life” thing seems to necessitate is this: “Can a name recorded in God’s ‘book of life’ ever be removed?” As always must be our course, let’s see what God says. From the Old Testament first, in Exodus 32:33 , God is addressing Moses concerning His own people, the Israelites, regarding their sin, “And the Lord said to Moses, ‘Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book.”  That seems pretty clear! But what about the New Testament, the Covenant all today are under? In the letter to the church at Sardis, God is again addressing His own people ( i.e. Christians ). Revelation 3:3,5 records these words, “Remember therefore what you have received and heard; and keep it, and repent .  If  therefore you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come upon you…. He who overcomes shall thus be clothed in white garments ; and I will not erase his name from the book of life…” Now, when God says that He would not remove the names of those who overcome sin by repenting and keeping His word, what does that imply for those who don’t do these things? Plainly, it means that God both  can  and  will  erase their names from His book of life!   Brethren beware: not only is it  possible  for us to have our names removed from God’s book after they’ve once been recorded there, it is a  promise  from God that they  will  be erased  if  we fail to “hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end,”  Hebrews 3:14 !"],"title":["God’s Eraser"],"_resultNumber":155,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/gods_eraser","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":155},{"body":["Over the years I’ve actually enjoyed cutting brush and clearing land. It’s typically hard hot work, but everything just looks so much better after you’re done. And since three sides of our lot have a mostly bamboo border, I usually have plenty of opportunities to hone my skills! But I must confess that while I don’t really mind running the chainsaw, if the brush has to be loaded on a trailer and hauled away, well, did I mention I don’t really mind running the chainsaw? Unfortunately, although Donna is great at many things, she’s lousy at loading and hauling brush! As with most things in life, there are lessons to be learned from brush cutting/loading. I was reminded of a couple of them recently because there was no one around to load on the trailer all the brush I had cut!   Lesson #1: If you care about keeping things spiritually “clean” in your life, there are going to be times when you have to do some “spiritual pruning.” Like physical brush cutting, sometimes the spiritual kind just requires a quick snip or two here and there with shears, cf. John 15:2 ; but other times, you have to get the machete or ax involved, cf. Matthew 3:10 . And occasionally, you have to fire up the chainsaw and really go to work! The level of effort required, and the seriousness of the tools involved, are usually determined by how long and how far we’ve let the briars and brambles of sin invade our lives. Consistent attention and diligence toward “nipping sin in the bud” eliminates most of the need for major hacking and clearing later.   Lesson #2:  Spiritual “chainsaws,” like their physical counterparts, once fired up and put to work, can often cut more than we can clean up! Once all the pruning and cutting is done, there is still a mess to clean up in order to put things right. This too is often hard work- perhaps even harder at times than identifying the problems, or our initial efforts to deal with them. Still yet, If we just “wade in and start hacking,” two things usually result: 1) we wind up cutting more than we intended, and some “good” parts get damaged or destroyed, cp. Romans 14 (especially vv.16-21 ); and unless we’re careful, 2) we almost always wind up making a bigger mess than we intended, or can clean up, cf. Galatians 6:1-5 .   Lesson #3: When loading brush, keeping the wind at your back means you get a lot less dirt in your face! “Keeping the wind at your back” while cleaning and loading up spiritual brush means having the God-breathed wind of inspiration behind you! God’s word not only tells us what’s good and what’s “brush,” Galatians 5:16-26 , it also provides instructions on how to go about dealing with the bad: don’t deny but do confess your sins to God, 1John 1:8-9 ; and, repent (change, turn from) and pray for forgiveness, Acts 8:21-22 . These inspired (literally God + wind or breath ) methods for loading and hauling away the spiritual brush in our lives as Christians keeps additional dirt out of our face because we have the very wind of God’s inspiration behind us! But trying to deal with our sins in some other uninspired way just means we have another face full of dirt coming. Doing things God’s way always works better, just like loading brush with the wind at your back.  Additionally, sometimes we’re called upon to help others with their spiritual brush. Here, too, we need the wind of God’s inspiration squarely behind us. Jesus tells us how to go about it in Matthew 18:15-17 . “If your brother sins,”  v.15a , is not the same as his doing something you don’t like or wouldn’t do. Be sure “sin,” as determined by the inspiration of God, is involved before you fire up your chainsaw! “Go and reprove him in private,”  v.15b , is not the same as telling everyone else but him what he has done wrong- go to him with the matter. “If he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you,”  v.16 , does not mean to turn this into a “witch hunt.” Remember, the point is to save his soul by having multiple witnesses confirm his need of salvation- not to destroy him. “If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church,”  v.17a , is the next to last step- not the first one. Nonetheless, the church has a part to play in dealing with spiritual brush that individuals refuse to clean up, v.17b . The only way to keep from getting additional “dirt” in your face when dealing with the “brush” of sin- yours or someone else’s, is to keep the wind of God’s inspiration behind you!

On the simplest level, “repentance” is “change.” In Matthew 3:2 , John the Baptist told his audiences to “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” He was telling them they needed to change.  A little more specifically, repentance is a change of mind that leads to a change of activity, course, and direction, cf. 2Corinthians 12:21 . Through the process of salvation, repentance also leads one to a change of allegiance . One changes, or switches, “teams” by moving from “the domain of darkness…to the kingdom of His beloved Son,” ( Colossians 1:13 ).  After one is on the Lord’s side, the need for repentance is still present, because sin is not completely eliminated from our lives. Christians do not forget how to sin, and God does not overlook or excuse sin just because the perpetrator belongs to Him, cf. Acts 8:12-13, 20-24 . After all, isn’t wrong still “wrong” even when your child does it? 1John 3:4 indicates that sin is “sin” for everyone. Thus, the need for repentance is an ever-present part of everyone’s life.  Given these things, why don’t we all just repent and do our part to make things right ( Matthew 3:8 ) when we sin? The answer to this one is simple: Repentance is hard. Why? A couple of reasons should be readily apparent: 1) we don’t really like to admit that we’re wrong (which requires a change of mind); and, 2) we don’t really like to amend our lives (which would obviously require a change of activity, course, and direction). So, what do we do instead? We retreat to the “weakness” defense.  The “weakness” defense is claiming that our lack of repentance, evidenced by habitual sin (committing the same sin, or sins, over and over), is due to “weakness” rather than a refusal to repent. There is no doubt that some sins we commit, even repetitively, are due to weakness- either in knowledge or strength, which come with maturity. But if we have been Christians long enough to be meat-eaters ( cf. Hebrews 5:12-14 ), and are still defending our lack of repentance by claiming “weakness,” the problem is likely rebellion instead.  It soon becomes all too easy to attribute our repetitive sins to “weakness,” and make prayerful requests for God to forgive them on that basis, without really making any effort at all to repent. However, we must remember that forgiveness of sins is linked to repentance, instead of perpetual weakness. Consider two passages from Acts on this point: “Repent therefore and return, that your sins may be wiped away, in order that the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,”  3:19 ; and, “Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray the Lord that if possible, the intention of your heart may be forgiven you,”  8:22 .  Is weakness a very real cause of sin? Absolutely. Is it also true that many of us are all too content with feigned “weakness” because we enjoy sin and don’t really want to change (repent)? Positively, and that makes us “rebellious”- not weak, “for there are many rebellious men, empty talkers and deceivers…”  Titus 1:9 .  Repentance isn’t easy, but it is required, Luke 13:3,5 . We can’t keep deceiving ourselves into thinking that perpetual weakness is a pardonable excuse for sin. At some point, we have to own up to the fact that we’re actually rebelling against God through our continued knowledgeable disobedience of His will. We could do better, if we just would . Unfortunately, “I just couldn’t help myself” is a lie we tell ourselves, others, and even God in an effort to absolve our failures to do what we know is right. The truth is that we usually know better, and can do better, but just choose not to  do better, cf. 1Corinthians 10:13 . So, let’s decide to stop hiding behind purported weaknesses, and do the “right” things. Otherwise, we may well be just making a “provision for the flesh in regard to its lust” ( Romans 13:14 ), and that sounds an awful lot like “rebellion!”"],"title":["Repentance, Weakness, and Rebellion"],"_resultNumber":157,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/repentance_weakness_and_rebellion","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":157},{"body":["Please Note: This article ran in our local newspaper and church bulletin prior to our Gospel Meeting, September 25-28, 2011 with Bro. Mike McLemore of Hunstville, Alabama. Therefore it was originally intended to advertise that special series of lessons by the same title. Perhaps the rest of the article will still be useful for you- hence its inclusion here on the website.  Sometime around 51-52 A.D. the apostle Paul came to Corinth to preach the gospel. Many of the Corinthians “when they heard were believing and being baptized.” ( Acts 18:8 ) Thus began the church at Corinth. It was a church with a lot of potential, but by the time Paul wrote 1Corinthians back to them five or six years later, it was a church with a lot of problems. The litany of troubles this church had developed is quite evident from simply reading the letter Paul wrote them. We note they were: divided( 1:10ff ); spiritually immature and carnal ( 3:1-3ff ); spiritually arrogant ( 4:6-21 ); tolerant of gross immorality ( chp.5 ); sinfully litigious ( 6:1-8 ); apparently needing to flee immorality ( 6:18ff ); turning the Lord’s Supper into a common meal ( 11:17-34 ); and abusing spiritual gifts ( chps.12-14 ). As if this wasn’t enough, some of them evidently no longer believed in the resurrection of the dead ( 15:12ff ).  These surely seem to be a lot of problems for a church to develop in only five or six years of existence! But we need to be careful since our churches have likely been around a lot longer, and probably have many, if not more, of the same problems. We also have to realize that churches with problems have them because they are comprised of members with problems. Actually, it is not much different for individuals than it is for churches: those with potential are also potentially problematic. The same energy and enthusiasm that “gets the ball rolling” can just as easily roll it “into the ditch” unless constant reassessment occurs.  So what do we do when we or our churches seem to have “rolled into the ditch” of sin or stagnation? The answer is very simple: We get “Back to Basics.”  Every athlete has heard it from a coach at some point. When the baseball or golf swing is out of whack, “Get back to basics.” When tackles are being missed or volleys hit into the net, “Get back to basics.” When the jump shot or free throws aren’t falling, again, the answer is “Get back to basics.” There’s really no difference in spiritual matters. When our life is in shambles and completely off course, we have to “get back to basics” there too.  Look again at the Corinthians. What were they told to do? Those divided were told to “agree… (and) be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment” through the “name (authority) of our Lord Jesus Christ”  1:10 . Those who were immature and carnal were told to grow up and become spiritual,  3:4-23 . Those who were spiritually arrogant were told “not to exceed that which is written,” and to “be imitators” of the humble servant Paul, 4:6-16 . Those who tolerated gross immorality were told to “remove the wicked man from among yourselves” and “not to associate with immoral people” in the church, 5:5-13 . Those sinfully litigious were told that it was better to be “wronged.…(or) defrauded” than to go to law with one another. Those involved in immorality were told to “flee” it and to remember that they were “bought with a price”,  6:18-20 . Those abusing the Lord’s Supper were told to remember how and why it was instituted, 11:23-26 ; to eat it in a worthy manner,  11:27-29 ; to “wait for one another” in their partaking, 11:33 ; and to eat their common meals  at home,  11:34 . Those abusing spiritual gifts were given rules to govern their proper usage, 1Cor.14:26-38 . And those mistaken about the resurrection were told again the things “of first importance” from the gospel ,  15:1-8 . None of these “solutions” was necessarily complicated- the Corinthians just had to “get back to basics.” The same thing holds true for us too!  Is your spiritual life in need of getting “Back to Basics”?

Let me see if I can get this to make sense for you.  A lot of words we commonly use have prefixes. A prefix is sometimes one letter, or perhaps two, or maybe even three that you tack on to the front of a base word to change its meaning. To “sub-marine” therefore means to go “under” the “water.”  But have you ever thought about how some of the words that we put these prefixes on really don’t have a place in our regular vernacular? For instance, you may have attended a Civil War  reenactment  if you’re into that sort of thing, or even a crime-scene  reenactment  if you were on a jury that took a field trip , but have you ever been to an  enactment?  Yep, that’s a real word alright, but you don’t usually hear it much around this part of the country.  What about this one: At one time or another you’ve probably been  disgruntled  in your life, right? But in your whole life, have you ever been  gruntled  ? I’m absolutely sure I’ve been  disgruntled   , and I’m even pretty sure I know what that means, but since the prefix “dis” means the opposite or absence of whatever base word it precedes, exactly what is “ gruntled” ? Actually, there is such a word as “gruntle” after all. It is defined by Mr. Webster as “to put in a good humor,” in case you didn’t already know- I sure didn’t!  Now all of that foolishness was to entertain perhaps just a little, but also to get to a point. Our title, in addition to “enactmenting” and “gruntled,” also includes the word “pents.” If you look that one up with Mr. Webster he will tell you it means “to shut up” or “confine”- as in, pent-up feelings or emotions. But if you add the prefix “re” if front of it, well, then we have problems. If “pent” means to “shut up or confine” and “re” means “again,” then “re-pent” would have to mean “shut up or confine again,” wouldn’t it? Now we both know that doesn’t make much sense- even to the valedictorian (of a total class of 15, mind you) son of an Ag teacher! But hold on, this gets better, I promise.  The trouble we’re having with the word “re-pent” is that it is translated from a couple of Greek words into our English version- and trust me, it makes more sense in Greek! The Greek prefix “meta” (translated as “re”) means “after.” The Greek base word is “noeo,” and literally means “to think.” Thus, the Greek word, metanoeo, translated into our English word “repent,” means “to think again.” Therefore, to “repent” is literally to rethink , or change one’s mind . Those who had demanded Jesus’ crucifixion because they believed Him to be an imposter, were told to  repent  (and be baptized , Acts 2:28 ) - to re-think and change their minds!  But in the New Testament, evidently “repenting” includes more than just changing the mind. John the Baptist told his audience, “Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance…” in Luke 3:8 . This changing of the mind is supposed to also produce a change in course, direction, or conduct. It’s not just changing your mind- its changing your mind so that your actions change too!  Now, what if we put all those silly words from the title together in the light of our new-found understanding of them? An “enactment” is something that has been acted out. To “gruntle” is to make happy. And, to “repent” is to re-think and change your mind so that your course, or direction, changes. Put them all together and what do you get? You become “happy” because you’ve “changed your mind” and are “acting” accordingly, see Genesis 4:6-7a ! See how easy that was?

I know- I’ve been there. My grandfather raised hogs for various major pork companies, the names of which you could read on your breakfast sausage package. As a little boy, I remember clamoring over a seemingly endless maze of fences in an effort to keep up with him as he fed and watered literally hundreds of hogs- which, by the way, don’t smell any better in large numbers.  Later, as a high-school student, I raised registered hogs, and sold full-blood and full-blood crosses for breeding stock (the full-blood ones stink too!). And thus, I had pigpens of my own to smell and wade through. Though baby pigs are about the cutest, softest, and funniest critters you can imagine, they soon become “hogs” with all of the implied nastiness of the term fully intended. They aren’t just called “hogs” because of their appetites, you know! (Did I mention they smell bad too?)  So, why would anyone need to be thankful for such a putrid place as a pigpen? That’s easy, though I detest the smell of live swine, I love the smell of dead pork- especially over an open flame! If I could only have one kind of meat to eat for the rest of my life, with no hesitation at all I’d choose pork. I love bacon, I love sausage, I love ham, I love pork chops, I love pork ribs, I love pork tenderloin, I love pork tamales, I even love fired pork rinds! However, I draw the line at pig’s feet- preferring instead to do my eatin’  a little ‘higher’ on the hog! So, as malodorous as they are, I’m thankful for pigpens, for without them I’d have no pork to eat- and that would be, for me at least, a true tragedy! But, there’s another significant reason we should all be thankful for pigpens….  It usually takes the putridity of “pigpen” in our lives to make us realize the depth of depravity and despair to which we have sunk. In this regard, we are often like the prodigal son of Luke 15 . This young man arrogantly demanded his inheritance before the customary time, then quickly departed to a distant land and “devoured your (the father’s) wealth with harlots,” at least according to his older brother, v.30 . But think about it:  When  and  where  was it that this young man “came to his senses,”  v.17 ? It wasn’t when he was demanding and receiving the wealth of his father, v.12 . It wasn’t when he was out on his own, perhaps for the first time in his life, and traveling to a far country, v.13a . It wasn’t when he was enjoying the “high life” of “loose living,”  v.13b .It wasn’t even when “he began to be in need,”  v.14 . None of these did the trick, but the “pigpen” did it! The stench, filth, and degradation of the pigpen was the “rock bottom” this young Jewish man had to hit to jar some sense back into him, cf. vv.16-19 .  However, don’t overlook an important part of a sentence that we often read through without really considering. The latter part of v.16 states, “and no one was giving anything to him.” Suppose someone had given him something. Do you suppose he would have “come to his senses” then? It may be merely conjecture, and especially so since this is a made-up story in the first place, but I’m betting that if it hadn’t been for “the pigpen,” his spiritual awakening would have never occurred. How can I be so sure? It’s human nature to some degree. As long as we “have all the answers” and everything we think we need, we’re pretty independent… and arrogant. But, when we have nowhere else to turn, and have exhausted all “our” resources (and sinful pride!), and wake up in some “pigpen” of our own making,  then  we humbly recognize our dependence on our Father.  Unfortunately, it often takes the complete abasement of a putrid “pigpen” to purify us. So, if a “pigpen” is what is required to get you to a spiritual awakening of your dependence upon God, and your need of the cleansing only Jesus can offer ( Acts 22:16 ), be thankful for that “pigpen”!"],"title":["Be Thankful for Pigpens"],"_resultNumber":160,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/be_thankful_for_pigpens","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":160},{"body":["Some think the hardest three words in the English language to say are, “I love you.” This is simply not true anymore, if it ever was before. Many people can say those three words all too easily and not really mean them. The three words that seem to have become the hardest for people these days to say are, “I was wrong.”  Even when forced by circumstances, most equivocate and attempt to justify themselves with statements like “I made an error in judgment” or “It wasn’t the best decision I could have made under the circumstances.” But if they are not pushed into unavoidable accountability, most will adeptly shift the responsibility of their own wrong doing to anyone or anything other than themselves. You hardly ever hear anyone say, “I was wrong” anymore, especially if there is any way out of it. Why is this? Didn’t there used to be something admirable about being willing to admit that you had been wrong? Not to glorify the wrongness of it, but to at least take responsibility for the error. And wasn’t it generally understood that such an admission was also an implied commitment and desire to do better in the future? Now it seems these three words are viewed as an admission of intellectual weakness- that you couldn’t come up with a clever way out of the admission of guilt!  Shifting the blame or denying responsibility isn’t anything new. In the Garden of Eden, after Adam and Eve’s sin, Adam blamed Eve, Eve blamed the Serpent, and he (as the old joke goes) didn’t have a leg to stand on! The first king of Israel, when confronted with his sin by God’s prophet Samuel, tried to blame the people and even God, cf. 1Samuel 15:15-21 . Even when forced to an admission of his own guilt, Saul still waffled and said, “I have sinned; I have indeed transgressed the command of the Lord and your words,  because I feared the people and listened to their voice.”  ( v.24 ) He was God’s appointed leader. He was the king, but he still blamed his subjects for his own sin even in his confession of it. So it has been- so it is today: even when guilt is tacitly admitted, there is always some “justifying” excuse attached to it. “I was wrong” has apparently become the hardest three-word phrase in the English language to utter.  There are two points I’d like you to consider regarding these things. First of all, we must understand the importance of accountability. The apostle Paul wrote, “For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according what he has done, whether good or bad.” ( 2Corinthians 5:10 ) This accountability is to God, not other men. It is final, eternal, and unavoidable. It cannot be shifted to someone else, or otherwise justified or excused. Everyone will face it, and face up to their activity or inactivity regarding God’s word, PERIOD.  Secondly, full acceptance of responsibility for our sin (confession) and a turning from it (repentance) expunges the record of God. God promises that if we admit our wrongs and turn from them, “I will be merciful to their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more.” ( Hebrews 8:12 ) Consider also, “Repent therefore and return, that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord;”  Acts 3:19 . But we cannot “turn” from our sins in repentance unless we first take responsibility for them. Shifting the blame for them or otherwise trying to justify or excuse them won’t cut it. We have to understand, accept, and say “I was wrong” to God, and to those whom we’ve wronged when others are involved. Then, we have to prove the sincerity of our confession by turning from the wrong and doing right.  How many relationships with God, spouses, families, friends, co-workers, and certainly brethren could be repaired if we would just accept responsibility for our sins without equivocation, say “I was wrong,” and then prove that we mean it by doing better? Not to mention how many souls could be spared from eternal judgment by the same?"],"title":["Sin and Repentance"],"_resultNumber":161,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/sin_and_repentance","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":161},{"body":["I’m almost always in favor of New Testament baptism, which means: the right precept  (or teaching, one can’t be taught ‘wrong’ and baptized ‘right,’ Titus 3:5 ); the right person  (a penitent believer, Acts 2:37-38 ); the right procedure  (immersion in water, Colossians 2:12 ); and the right purpose  (to “wash away sins,”  Acts 22:16 ). But, I am against baptism if/when the candidate says he was saved at the point of faith, and then wants to be baptized because “It’s the ‘right’ thing to do.” In this scenario, it is absolutely the ‘wrong’ thing to do, but perhaps not for the reason(s) you suspect….  In regard to salvation, the New Testament uses the term “dead” in at least a couple of ways. For instance, Ephesians 2:1-2 says, “you were dead   in trespasses and sins , in which you formerly walked…”. But, Romans 6:2-7 also describes becoming  “dead to sin”  that we might “walk in newness of life” by being united with Christ “in the likeness of His resurrection.” Obviously, there is a huge difference between being dead  “in”  sin, and being dead  “to”  sin! The first implies slavery through sin, and yields spiritual condemnation; while the second intimates emancipation from sin, and results in spiritual salvation. Let’s look further at this second scenario of becoming “dead to sin” from Romans 6 .  There are some important aspects of becoming “dead to sin” and “alive to Christ” that we need to consider relative to baptism. In v.2 , the divine record says that those “who died to sin” shouldn’t “still live in it.” This means that the “saved” person must “crucify his old self” and no longer bea “slave to sin,”  cf. vv.6-11 . Baptism is linked to this process in vv.3-4 . How so?   Romans 6:3 says that baptism is the means by which we contact Christ’s death, “Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into  His  death.” Why is this crucial? Christ’s blood was shed in His death, and we need to contact the blood of Christ for salvation, Ephesians 1:7 . Baptism, then, puts us in contact with the redeeming power of Christ’s shed blood by which we are saved.   Romans 6:4 adds that we are “buried with Him through baptism into death…”. There are two important points I’d like to make from this. The first one is obvious: baptism is a burial. We are immersed in water as Jesus was immersed in the earth . No one is “buried” by sprinkling or pouring a little dirt on them and calling it a “burial.” Jesus was “in” the earth, and to be scripturally baptized after this figure, one must be “in” (covered by) water.  The second point from Romans 6:4 may not be so obvious, but is nonetheless critical to our proper understanding: baptism is “into death”. Notice that Jesus’ death, mentioned in v.3 , is not specified in v.4 . This is because baptism includes both our access to Jesus’ death (and therefore, His blood ), as well as being the mechanism that marks the “end” of our life of sin and slavery to it. In other words, we not only “put to death” our “old man of sin,” we “bury” him because he’s dead to us, cf. v.11 !  Now think this through carefully:  If  we become spiritually “alive” (saved) at the point of faith, and thus prior to baptism, we should never be baptized. Why? Because you don’t bury “live” folks- you bury “dead” folks! And as my old preacher-friend Brother Floyd Offing once said on this point, “It’s against the law to bury ‘live’ folks just about everywhere!” (He had a remarkable way with words!) Baptism is a “burial,” and you just don’t bury people that are “alive”- either physically or spiritually. You bury the “dead”- physically, but also spiritually. The physically dead are buried to await the great and final resurrection, cf. 1Corinthians 15:12-58 . The spiritually dead (to sin) are buried “in order that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life,”   Romans 6:4b .  The New Testament indeed teaches that we “saved by faith,”  Ephesians 2:8-9 . It nowhere teaches that we are saved “by faith alone .” In fact, the only text in which the words “faith” and “alone” appear together is in James 2:24 , “You see that a man is justified by works, and  not by faith alone.”  I want everyone to be baptized- but based on the scriptural teaching, in the scriptural way, and for the scriptural reasons."],"title":["Burying “Live” People"],"_resultNumber":162,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/burying_live_people","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":162},{"body":["Many years ago, a friend of mine and I went to another church to hear a visiting preacher they had brought in to speak for about a week’s worth of services. After the sermon and services were over, and we were back in the privacy of the car, I wryly asked, “Well, what did you think of the sermon?” I’ll never forget his matter-of-fact reply, “I was underwhelmed,” he said. I expected some sort of answer like that, which is why I waited until we were in the car to ask, but I didn’t expect that particular one! “Underwhelmed” was a word which I had never heard, but immediately added to my vocabulary because it so appropriately fit. I too had been underwhelmed by the lesson! Though nothing said was overtly unscriptural, the points being made lacked real relevancy, and were produced with a blustering passion and zeal which was therefore misguided, and thus fell flat. James and I were both underwhelmed. But this got me to thinking…  Have you ever been  underwhelmed  with regard to some spiritually-oriented expectation? Perhaps becoming a “Christian” wasn’t exactly what you expected. Naaman certainly wasn’t a “Christian,” but surely was underwhelmed when Elisha didn’t even come out of the house to heal his leprosy, let alone make a grand spectacle of it, but instead just word by a messenger for him to go dip in the Jordan, 2Kings 5:9ff . We too can be underwhelmed if we’re expecting some bright-light experience or some extravagant ceremony to achieve salvation. Jesus, like Elisha, kept becoming “clean” simple, “Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved…”  Mark 16:16 . Salvation is a spiritual cleansing of the soul, not a carnal gratification for our egos. If you’re underwhelmed with Christianity, you’re probably doing it wrong; and likely for the wrong reasons. You’ve probably made it about you, rather than Christ. “I am afraid, lest as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds should be led away from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ,”  2Corinthians 11:3 .  Have you ever been  overwhelmed   , or at least felt that way, at the notion of becoming or being a Christian? Becoming a Christian should be an overwhelming experience, at least in the strictest sense of the word. It should completely engulf you. But you shouldn’t be exasperated by becoming one, or by trying to remain one. There is no doubt that living a Christian life is challenging, and can be quite difficult at times. Read Romans 7:15-24 and realize that even Paul sometimes shared that perspective. But again, if you’re overwhelmed at the prospects of living a Christian life, then you’re probably doing it wrong. You’re probably trying to do it on your own: without appropriating the power of prayer, cf. James 1:2-5 ; without taking full advantage of the education, edification, and encouragement of fellow Christians in the local church, Ephesians 4:11-16 ; and without realizing that “it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure,”  Philippians 2:13 . God does not want you to “exasperate” (or overwhelm ) our children ( Colossians 3:21 ), and He doesn’t do that you either- at least not if you live as He directs.  We’ve covered being both under and overwhelmed, but have you ever been truly  whelmed   ? Yes, that’s a real word. It means: “to engulf or submerge in water” ( Encarta Dictionary ). Ah, we’re back to baptism since biblical baptism is an immersion in water! If this is doubted, just check Colossians 2:12 again, and ask yourself this question: Do you “bury” someone by sprinkling or pouring a little dirt on him, or do you submerge and engulf him with dirt? Biblical baptism is a “burial” through which we become “dead to sin,” and are then “resurrected” to a new life (and thus are “born again” ) when we come up out of the water, Romans 6:3-4 . If you haven’t been biblically baptized for the remission of your sins ( Acts 2:38 ), you still have them.  Friend, being properly  whelmed  by having your sins “washed away” through faith and baptism ( Acts 22:16 ) will go a long way toward keeping you from being either  under  or  overwhelmed  in your walk of faith!

Neither is the purpose of this article to call into question the individual judgment of sincere Christians on either side of the issue. Instead, it is only hoped that some consideration of biblical principles will be gained which could lead to better understanding of why we do what we do, and the effects our actions may have on others.     First, consistency is in order. I have known Christians who strongly objected to any celebration of, or public display of the decorations associated with, Christmas. OK, but the interesting thing was that these same folks did decorate (even outside) for, and celebrate, Halloween! “Consistency, thou art a jewel” seems to fit these well-meaning brethren. It’s perfectly fine with me for a brother to object to and therefore not observe either holiday, because of dubious origins and associations past participators had for the occasions. REALLY, I’m fine with that. But it seems that consistency would not allow the forbidding of one and the celebration of the other.    If “Christmas” must be avoided because of the ways people past and present associate it with the birth of Christ, then why would “Halloween” be acceptable when its derivation goes back to a Celtic celebration in which it was thought that the barrier between the dead and the living was removed, and that “the gods” played “tricks” on mortals (thereby making it a dangerous time)?    Next, its always dangerous to assign motives to other people’s actions, 1Cor.2:11. We may be able to discern “what” they do by observation or other credible means, but “why” they do them is not ours to decide– especially in these particular instances. It is just as wrong for me to conclude that someone is a devil worshipper because their children go out “trick or treating” on Halloween as it is to conclude that someone is (or is not) a Christian because they have or don’t have decorations up celebrating Christmas. Neither proves the case. In an interesting twist, I read in Wikipedia (an online encyclopedia) that those who claim to be “true witches” are actually offended by the trivialization of their “kind” found in typical Halloween celebrations! And there have been many who think themselves “true Christians” that are likewise offended at what they call a “commercialization” of what they believe to be a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. So, what to do? Let me offer a few suggestions:    Know the truth. The Bible no where commands or suggests that Christians should celebrate the birth of Christ. Roughly 65 years of history are covered in your New Testament from the ascension of Christ in Acts 1 until the close of the book of Revelation, and yet not one word is recorded about any Christian ever celebrating Jesus’ birth. And yet, first-century Christians, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, were commanded to, and did celebrate, the death of Christ each Sunday, 1Cor.11:23-26; Acts 20:7. Likewise, the New Testament no where condemns children (or adults) dressing up in costumes and having non-sinful fun.      Use common sense. Any celebration of any kind usually has a meaning to those who are celebrating. Just because one person celebrates Christmas as the birth of Jesus doesn’t mean that everyone else does. Nor is it true that just because some people a few hundred years ago really believed that evil spirits came from the dead to plague the living means that every kid with plastic jack-o-lantern who collects candy on October 31st either is, or has parents who are, devil-worshippers. Both holidays have particular meaning, or perhaps “lack of meaning” in this case, to those who celebrate them. In my opinion, “Christmas” can be celebrated as a secular holiday without religious attachments, and “Halloween” can likewise be celebrated as a secular holiday with satanic attachments.   Be careful of your influence. Don’t do things on either holiday that damage your influence as a Christian. Obviously, many people of the world “get religious” around the end of December. You’re supposed to be a Christian all the time! But don’t say and do things because “’tis the season” that mislead others into thinking that you believe things about the holiday that you don’t. Conversely, there is also the tendency to “let go” and do things around the end of October that you perhaps wouldn’t be inclined to do without the holiday. Again, you’re supposed to be a Christian all the time– and the last night of October is included!   Be tolerant of other’s non-sinful judgments. It is not sinful to refuse to celebrate either Christmas or Halloween because of personal convictions. Don’t think less of brethren who feel this way, Rom.14:3. And on the other side of the issue, likewise don’t think that brethren who choose to celebrate Christmas and Halloween are sinning because they believe themselves to be commemorating the birth of Jesus and a pagan ritual either. Such does not follow.    Obviously, these are just my thoughts on the matters– you are completely free to disagree if you like. Just please remember the words of Romans 14:5, “One man regards one day above another, another regards every day alike. Let each man be fully convinced in his own mind.” Whether you celebrate Halloween and Christmas or not, know why, and try to be tolerant of others who may not feel the same about them that you do."],"title":["Should Christians Celebrate Halloween?"],"_resultNumber":165,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/should_christians_celebrate_halloween","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":165},{"body":["A line from classic a \"western shoot 'em up\" movie may be an unusual way to start a bulletin article, and \"Josey Wales\" was certainly no Christian, but he did say something that made me think.....    One of my favorite western movies is “The Outlaw Josey Wales”. And “no,” it is not the most godly, or family-oriented, movie out there. But as with most westerns, the good guys win in the end. There are several memorable lines in the movie- there’s even a website that lists them ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075029/quotes )! But there is one line in particular that includes the title of this article, though it was not on the website. It occurs near the end of the movie, right before the big gun battle scene. The main character, Josey Wales, is giving a pep-talk to his ragtag band of old men and women who are about to fight a bunch of trained, but lawless, soldiers. The “good guys” are preparing a small house to be a fort, and getting all their assigned duties from Josey. Knowing they would be facing seemingly insurmountable odds, Wales begins to tell his friends that when the bad guys start breaking through their defenses, and it looks like it’s about to end badly, he snarls and growls (paraphrased), “Then you gotta get mean, mad-dog fighting mean!”     Certainly, I’ll be the first to admit that this is an unusual way to begin an article for a church bulletin. But it always has seemed to me that even this crude and graphic language has a good spiritual application. I think we sometimes need to adopt the mentality Josey was urging of his cohorts. We too, sometimes face seemingly insurmountable odds in our “fight” against Satan and sin. But all too often, we don’t get “mad-dog fighting mean” in our struggle with the forces of evil, either those that are internal, or those which are external. Instead, we roll over and play dead (in keeping with the “dog” metaphor)! We don’t get our dander up and fight “like we’ve never fought before”- we give up and run away with our proverbial tales between our legs…. and Satan wins! And if we do it often enough, we’ll forget how to fight the passions and pride of sin altogether and make pacifist’s pact with the Devil. 1Timothy 4:1 , “But the Spirit explicitly says that in the latter times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron,” . If we “resist” sin as God commands, it may well mean more than just saying “no”- resisting might mean going on the offensive in the fight . Think about it, the Devil is depicted in 1Peter 5:8 as a “roaring lion” . Now, if you’re locked in a struggle to the death with a lion, you’re not going to be able to talk your way ou t, negotiate your way out , or play-dead your way ou t. There is but one way out: you’re going to have to get “mad-dog fighting mean” and fight your way out !     Make no mistake about it: the roaring lion and his “rulers….powers… and world-forces of this darkness” ( cf. Ephesians 6:12 ) are not playing tidily winks here- they mean to kill your soul! While we fool around with their sinful influences- thinking them relatively harmless because, after all, “they won’t affect me,” they’re playing for eternal “keeps”. Remember, “forever” is forever. You and I had better realize that we are in the immortal “fight of (and for) our lives” and get mad-dog fighting mean in it!    Look, I know that 2Corinthians 10:3 says, “ For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.” I’ll be one of the first to say that we do not, or should not, endeavor to use “carnal weapons” in our struggle against Satan and sin. But , please do not make the mistake for forgetting that we are at war! Or, at least we’re supposed to be at war. Note that the verses following in 2 Corinthians 10 speak of “the weapons of our warfare…are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses.” When these words were inspired and written, war was not a “push button” computer screen affair. War was then hand-to-hand combat. It is one thing to sit miles away and watch the destruction of an enemy in an innocuous way. It is entirely something else to shove a an eighteen to twenty-four inch (typical Roman sword length at the time) piece of steel through him, withdraw it as he collapses, and move on to the next target as quickly as possible. But such was then the nature of war! These are the images portrayed by these verses when they speak of the “destruction of fortresses” because it was what was involved. In such a struggle, passivity gets you nothing but killed! The survivors of this kind of struggle, just like in “Josey Wales”, had better get mad-dog fighting mean or they will lose much more than their lives….they’ll lose their souls!    Please don’t misunderstand my point. I’m not suggesting that Christians must become angry, violent, and aggressive people in their day-to-day interactions of life with other people. Certainly not! I am saying that we must take on a soldier’s mentality of aggressively fighting for our spiritual lives in our struggle against sin within ourselves, and against the forces of Satan without. Sin and Satan’s fortresses are between you and the heavenly reward….what are you going to do about it? “Mad-dogs” that are “fighting mean” destroy whatever stands in their way."],"title":["“Mad-Dog Fighting Mean”"],"_resultNumber":166,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/mad-dog_fighting_mean","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":166},{"body":["It was simply a gorgeous day- I was “off” work and had vowed not to even turn “on” a computer. Time was right to catch-up on some outside chores at home, and what a beautiful day for it. The birds were flitting around in such a seemingly joyful way that they couldn’t help but sing. The difficulties of winter were finally over. Flowers were exploding into cascading blossoms that filled the air with a sweet but tangy fragrance. It seemed that you could almost see buds bursting forth into unfurling leaves. The soil was again soft, moist, warm, and rich with life. After buying a battery for the lawnmower, there was no doubt about it, Spring was officially in full bloom.  It doesn’t normally take much more than an hour to mow our fairly large yard, but on this occasion I was in no real hurry. The Spring grasses (and weeds!) were thick and wet, and the remaining wild winter rye stems were tough, so I was just easing along on the mower so it would cut smoother. Besides, I was also towing a six-foot steel roller weighted with a couple of pieces of railroad iron to help it flatten out all those gopher mounds and mole runs while I mowed. So, I had plenty of time to enjoy the beauties of God’s creation that were on display all around me.  Mowing has always been good sermon or article-thinking time for me. It doesn’t require a lot of concentration to go around in circles that get one width smaller with each pass! So the mind naturally wanders- and if I can get it to wander in the right direction, reflections on God and His creation inevitably sprout. On this particular day, the challenge was not to elicit those types of thoughts, but to limit them- it was just that kind of day! Perhaps they will help you also.   Spring reflects the goodness of God.   Romans 1:20 tells us that God’s “invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made…” God’s eternal power is evident within the complexity and symbiotic (interdependent and mutually beneficial relationship) nature of the creation- none of which “just happened by chance.” The eternal power of God made it happen! But, if you think about it, God could have created a monochrome world of varying shades of gray that was capable of sustaining a utilitarian existence for us- but He didn’t. Instead, He gave us a world that not only met all of our essential needs for life, but also exceeded even our wildest imaginations of wondrous beauty and phenomenally intense color. The goodness of God’s divine nature didn’t just provide us with a world to keep us alive. He gave us a world in which we could really enjoy living by exceeding our aesthetic desires also. Spring manifests the goodness of God’s divine nature!    Spring delivers a witness of God.  In Acts 14 , Paul and Barnabas performed a miracle of healing at Lystra. The pagan people there were so impressed that they began to worship them- giving them names of Greek gods. To refute this and give proper glory to God for the sign, Paul responded with these words, “And in the generations gone by He (God) permitted all the nations to go their own ways; and yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness,”  vv.16-17vv.16-17 . The warm rains and sunshine of Spring fuel the fruitful seasons of Summer and Fall. These are also evidence of God’s love and provision for all of His creation. They serve as a yearly witness to all who look, listen, and learn of God’s enduring endowment to the world.   Spring promises the renewal of  resurrection.  A couple of years of relative drought have taken their toll on many of the trees here in East Texas. Just a couple of weeks ago, I was trying to figure out the best way to remove a huge Elm tree that had fallen prey to the dry conditions. I sure hated to lose the towering tree, and procrastinated and put off the job. Now it is covered with budding leaves! Spring has amazing powers of resurrection. Though the tree was not truly “dead”- every visible shred of evidence indicated that it was. So too it is with our “death”- it is in reality just a peaceful slumber in which we await the great resurrection through which we will spring to eternal life, cf. John 5:28-29 and 1Corinthains 15 . As I marveled at everything “coming to life” again after winter’s slumber, I could not help but reflect on the renewal of life at that great day of resurrection! Spring is truly a beautiful witness of God and His goodness if we take time to notice and consider it."],"title":["Reflections of Spring"],"_resultNumber":167,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/reflections_of_spring","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":167},{"body":["While Jesus was training the twelve disciples to become “fishers of men” ( Matthew 4:19 ), He also told them, “I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now,”  John 16:12 . Have you ever wondered why this was so? Though we are not specifically told, I suspect that the answer has to do with growth, development, understanding, and time. With their spiritual growth and development, their understanding would increase so that as the events of time unfolded, they would later be able to “bear” truths that they currently could not.  It’s really not any different for would-be disciples today- it often takes some growth, development, and time for us to really understand and be able to “bear” (practice) some of Jesus’ words. For instance, consider His statement recorded in Acts 20:35 , “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” (By the way, though these words are quoted by Paul and recorded by Luke- both through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, they are not otherwise recorded by any of the four gospel writers.) When we are younger- in life or in faith, we may admit that such is true in principle, but have a hard time really seeing the value of it in practice!  But, the principle was not given as a maxim to promote a “holiday spirit” of charity, nor was it provided to be relegated to mere gift-giving applications. Jesus is instead describing a code of conduct in life for those who would be His disciples. While still immature in faith, we may submit to this rule because we know it is right, but not really “feel” the way we should about it. In other words, we may do the right thing in this regard without really believing or seeing the value in it ourselves. But with the growth and maturity that time allows, true understanding of the principle is gained. Let’s consider some specifics to illustrate our point. Do you think (in your mind), feel (in your heart), and believe (in your soul) that it is better for y ou  to give:   · Attention rather than to receive it? Or do you still crave, or even demand other’s attention like a little fella who wants everyone to focus on him? Read Philippian 2:1-4 , please.  · Support and Encouragement rather than to receive them? Are you one who always expects others to “help” and/or “support me,” but never seems to be found on the giving end of the matter? Please read 1Thessalonians 5:14-15 .  · Compassion and Sympathy rather than to receive them? Do you always expect others to listen to and commensurate with all your troubles and how “bad” you feel, and to provide sympathy and compassion to you, but rarely (if ever) are truly compassionate and sympathetic to anyone beside yourself? Read Colossians 3:12-13 , please.  · Education and Enlightenment rather than to receive them? When it comes to spiritual education and edification (to build up), are you a “giver” or just a “taker”? Please read Hebrews 5:12-14 .  · Forgiveness rather than to receive it? Are you one who wants (and expects) everyone else to forgive you whenever you ask- and whether there is any true sorrow for the offence or not, but are very begrudging when it comes to forgiving others? Read Ephesians 4:32 and James 2:13 , please.  · Love rather than to receive it? Do you desire or even demand unconditional love from others, but are quick to place conditions upon the love you give? Please read Matthew 5:44-48 .  Now do you see why some divine directives require the growth and maturity that only time and experience can provide to really understand, “bear,” and practice? While we are yet spiritually immature, we would much rather  receive than give  all of these things. In fact, our still adolescent faith may not allow us to be able to  give  them at all. Have you matured in your faith sufficiently to not only understand, but also to “bear” the principle that “It is more blessed to give than to receive”? If not, then maybe it is time to get busy and “grow up”!"],"title":["Giving or Receiving"],"_resultNumber":168,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/giving_or_receiving","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":168},{"body":["What’s the line from the old Sinatra song, “Regrets I’ve had a few….”? While many have honestly said, “I have no regrets” when speaking of a specific incident or the way they handled a certain circumstance, anyone who says they have no regrets about the entirety of their lives has either lived an extremely good and conscientious life, or is an arrogant fool. I’m betting on the latter option....  The apostle Paul did indeed say that he had lived his life “in all good conscience” in Acts 23:1 , but that is not the same thing as having no regrets. One can, as Paul did, live in such a way as to never violate his conscience, Philippians 3:6 . But, the conscience, especially apart from divine revelation, is a fallible guide. You’d be hard-pressed to find a better example of this than Paul himself. Though acting “in all good conscience” prior to understanding the truth about Jesus Christ, he persecuted Him and the church, Acts 9:1ff . After coming to know Jesus as God’s Son, Paul lived the rest of his life with the pressing weight of a huge pile of regrets! Note his own words in 1Tim.1:13,15 on this point, “even though I was formerly a blasphemer and persecutor and a violent aggressor…Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost of all.”   However, Paul also epitomizes the best-case scenario of how to deal with one’s regrets. The most important key to dealing with regrets is to first stop piling them up. It is difficult indeed to effectively and productively deal with the mistakes of our past while continuing to add to the list. While we probably will add new regrets to our pile, at the very least we should stop repeating the same old ones! Isn’t that the nature and composition of spiritual growth and development? So, when Paul realized, by the revelation of truth, that Jesus was the Christ, he immediately and completely changed course. Which, by the way, is the way one is supposed to repent (see also Acts 2:36-42 for an additional example). Paul thus went from being a persecutor of Jesus and the church to being a proclaimer of Him and a preacher/producer of the church. In this way, at least, he stopped piling up regrets!  We don’t have to be a persecutor of Christ and His church to have, or continue to pile up, regrets. Jesus said, “He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me scatters,”  Matthew 12:30 . If we’re not actively with Christ, and actively working in His cause and kingdom, then we are against Him. This should certainly be a cause of regret, but the solution is simple. Start by repenting of your negligence, and then proceed by moving in the right direction. Cain, after God rejected his improper sacrifice and worship, was angry and dejected. Note God’s own words of admonition to him in Genesis 4:6-7 , “Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen? If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up?”   No matter how far you’ve gone on the wrong course, the first thing to be done is to take that initial step on the proper path! You’ll never get to where you need and want to be, spiritually speaking, unless you stop piling up additional regrets by continuing to walk away from God in sin. Long ago, God spoke to His people through the prophet Isaiah, “Behold, the Lord’s hand is not so short that it cannot save; neither is His ear so dull that it cannot hear. But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hid His face from you, so that He does not hear,”  Isaiah 59:1-2 . If you don’t feel close to God, make no mistake about who moved! God is ever accessible and able to save, if we will but come to Him in repentance by doing the right things. “Repent therefore and return, that your sins may be wiped away, in order that the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,”  Acts 3:19 .   The second vital step in dealing with regrets (after you stop adding to the pile), is to not dwell on/in them. You may never completely forget your past sins- even though God does, Hebrews 8:12 , but you can’t wallow or bury yourself in them either. Note again Paul’s example and words, “Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it (salvation, PCS) yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind  and reaching forward to what lies ahead , I press on  toward the goal ….”  Philippian 3:13-14 . Wise people have regrets, but they stop adding to the pile, and don’t bury themselves in or with it either. Be wise in dealing with your regrets."],"title":["Dealing with Regrets"],"_resultNumber":169,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/dealing_with_regrets","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":169},{"body":["Randy Moss thinks he is the greatest (NFL) wide-receiver of all time, yet the statistical numbers reveal that although he might be in the top ten, he is far from the greatest. His self-perception is out of touch with reality, which reminds me of Gal.6:4 , “For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.” There is no doubt that Mr. Moss is a great “big play” receiver with tremendous talent- but it is also equally clear that he is a “diva” with a bad attitude that doesn’t give 100% to the team and its goals. He is much more interested in self-aggrandizement and self-promotion. The sad reality is that he probably could have been “the greatest ever” at his position if he had been willing to work hard on every play- whether he was the “featured,” or “first option,” receiver or not. But this he was not willing to do. He was more concerned with the spotlight for himself, than with the win for the team.  It strikes me that many of us (including me!) are sometimes like Mr. Moss in that we, too, are more concerned with our own “spotlight” or making the “big play” than with the overall good of the team. We’re more concerned with personal glory than with God’s glory. So, we take passages like Matthew 5:16 , “Let your light shine before men…” in the wrong way- thinking that we have to be the “bright star” that everyone sees. This leads us to constantly shining our “lights” in other people’s eyes to be sure they see how bright, shiny, and brilliant it is. Such misses the point of the passage entirely. The whole verse instead says, “Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” There are a couple of vital points that must be understood to correctly interpret and apply Jesus’ words.  For one thing, note that our lights are to be shone  “before”  men rather than “at” them. Our goal is not to show them how “bright” our lights are so they will realize how good and holy we are- such is a purely Pharisaical approach ( cf. Luke 18:11-12 ). Note specifically that the “brightness” of our respective lights is actually nowhere considered in Matthew 5:16 ! The only aspect of their brightness is “that they may see your good works…” It does not take a bright light in a world of seemingly total darkness to provide spiritual perception and clarity- it just takes a consistent light. One that is always “on”- not just when everyone is looking, or when the occasion is right for a “big play”!  Consistently and constantly doing the “right things” is of much more value in allowing others the opportunity to “see” and “glorify God” than some “big” or “flashy” play every now and then (in keeping with the football metaphor and Randy Moss). Remember, the purpose of others being able to “see your good works” is to allow them to “glorify your Father in heaven”- not you (or me)! Our examples are supposed to be about getting the win for the team, which is God and those on His side opposed to Satan and sin, rather than about personal glory or self-aggrandizement!  Look, it is easy to put out maximum effort for one play when you are going to be the featured player. It is another matter entirely to consistently give every play your best whether you get the ball and the spotlight or not. But, God is concerned with constancy. “Constancy” has much to do with consistency- it is freedom from fluctuation and change.  The New Testament (the NASV at least) doesn’t use the words “constancy,” or even “consistency”- but it has a lot to say about “steadfastness.” Steadfastness is that quality or state of being consistent; without the vacillation of highs and lows. Steadfastness is not about making the “big play” or having “the spotlight,” it is about always doing the right things in the right ways. To switch illustrations for just a moment, many of us would undoubtedly be willing to make the “big play” of dying for Jesus and our faith in Him. Are we just as willing to consistently and steadfastly live for Jesus every day, and every moment of every day?  Do this: take the time to read 1Corinthians 15:58 ; Colossians 1:11,23 ; 1Thessalonians 1:3 ; 2Thessalonians 3:5 ; Hebrews 6:19 ; and 2Peter 3:17 ; and reflect upon the value of constancy, consistency, and steadfastness in your daily walk with Christ. Then, allow your “light”- whether big and bright, or weak and dim, to be seen by others in such a way that the path to Jesus is illuminated for them through how you live your life every day."],"title":["The Underrated Value of Constancy"],"_resultNumber":170,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/the_underrated_value_of_constancy","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":170},{"body":["If you went to bible class as a youngster, you probably remember a song about a man named Zaccheus. You know, “Zaccheus was a wee little man, and a wee little man was he. He climbed up into a sycamore tree for he wanted the Lord to see.” Aren’t you glad this is a printed article rather than a live lesson so you don’t have to listen to me sing? As is often the case, at least for me, the “children’s” stories and songs we learned way back when have some real “grown-up” lessons included too- if we will just revisit and restudy them as adults.  Do you remember the story of Luke 19:1-10 ? Jesus came to the ancient city of Jericho. It was destroyed by God as the Israelites initially entered Canaan, cf. Joshua 6 . After the fall of the city, Joshua pronounced a curse upon whoever might rebuild it. Thus, 1Kings 16:34 records the fulfillment of that curse upon Hiel, the Bethelite, for that reason. Jericho was situated near major fords that allowed commerce to traverse the Jordan River. Therefore, it was a suitable place for a “chief tax-gatherer” like Zaccheus to reside and work. Evidently such was profitable work, for Zaccheus is described as “rich,”  v.2 . But this job also came with notable liabilities. Since the taxes were being collected and sent to Rome  from  the Jews typically  by  their countrymen, the “tax man” was despised and hated. Zaccheus apparently fit into this category.  But, being the “tax man” wasn’t his only challenge. As Jesus came near to the city, evidently a large crowd gathered. Zaccheus wanted to see Jesus, but because he was “small in stature,” he couldn’t see over the crowds, v.3 . However, he was determined- so he ran up ahead of the procession and climbed up a sycamore tree to enable a better view, v.4 . Such was surely neither a noble nor respectable activity for a man of his position, but Zaccheus didn’t allow these things to deter him! In what certainly must have been an embarrassing situation, at least at first, Jesus stopped the parade, looked up into the tree at Zaccheus, called him by name, and said, “hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house,”  v.5 . Zaccheus not only complied with Jesus’ demand, but “received Him gladly,”  v.6 . Though he did not directly deny the charge of being a “sinner,”  v.7 , he did voluntarily offer “half of my (his) possessions” to assist the poor if he had defrauded anyone, v.8 . For both his attitude and activity, Jesus pronounced Zaccheus to be a “son of Abraham,”  v.9 !  Let’s put the particulars of the story in perspective. Zaccheus did not get   “caught up in”  or  trust in either his position or wealth  . Do you, cf. Luke 12:33 ? Do these things prevent you from a close personal relationship with Jesus? Zaccheus was not deterred by obstacles- even his inherent one(s) , from “seeing” Jesus. We have all been given characteristics by our parents- either genetically or perhaps from teaching and training, that can be obstacles to our “seeing” Jesus (certainly the inverse may also be true). Do you allow your physical or spiritual inheritance to prevent you from truly “seeing” Jesus, cf. Matthew 10:34-37 ? Zaccheus, when presented with the opportunity to be with Jesus, offered no hesitation or excuse, but joyfully responded immediately.  How long have you been delaying your obedience or excusing your disobedience to the invitation of Jesus, cf. Luke 14:15-24 ? Zaccheus also penitently offered to make restitution for whatever wrongs he had committed. While restitution cannot be made for some sins (murder, etc.), are you refusing to repent of your sins- and perhaps even denying their sinfulness, cf. Luke 13:3,5; 24:47 ? Please understand: If an activity, lifestyle, or relationships was “sinful” prior to salvation, it is not made “holy” after salvation.  Salvation came to Zaccheus because he: did not trust in his wealth or position; was undeterred by obstacles- even the inherent ones; did not hesitate, delay, or offer excuses when faced with the Truth, but joyfully responded with acceptance and obedience; and allowed true repentance to repair what could be fixed from the past, and to amend his future course. Perhaps the song about a “Wee Little Man” didn’t convey all of those lessons, but the attitude and activity of Zaccheus as told through the inspiration of Luke surely did!"],"title":["Lessens from a “Wee Little Man”"],"_resultNumber":171,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/lessens_from_a_wee_little_man","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":171},{"body":["We’ve heard for years about the importance of “accepting Jesus.” And indeed, the New Testament teaches that there are some things about Him we must accept. We must accept, for instance, that He was/is the Son of God, “…if you knew Me, you would know My Father also….for unless you believe that I am He, you shall die in your sins.” ( John 8:19,24 ). We must also accept that He was born as “Jesus the Nazarene,” God-incarnate (God in human form), Acts 2:22 . Additionally, we must accept that He was crucified for our sins but triumphantly raised “both Lord and Christ” from the grave on the third day, Acts 2:32,36 . If these things are what is meant by “accepting Jesus” then I agree that such is certainly required in order to be saved. But, if we think that this is all there is to “accepting Him,” then I must disagree. There is a simple reason for my disagreement: such is not all that the New Testament has to say on the matter. Let me show you.     Just about everyone who desires some level of acceptability with God knows John 3:16 , “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.” While this great passage has become the proof text for “accepting Jesus,” is that all He had to say on the matter? In the same chapter ( John 3:36 ) Jesus also said, “He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.” It sure sounds like that there is more to this matter of salvation than just “accepting” the facts of who and what Jesus was and is. James 2:24 makes the matter even clearer when it reads, “You see that a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone.” I’m admittedly no Einstein, but apparently our “accepting Jesus” doesn’t mean that Jesus necessarily accepts us! “You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe and shudder. But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless.” These are not my words, they come from James 2:19-20 , and thus are the inspired words of God through James.    So, if salvation is not just about “accepting Jesus,” but also is about becoming “acceptable to Jesus,” how do we get to that point of acceptability? There are many passages that could be used, but notice carefully Titus 2:11-14 , “For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in this present age, looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus; who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.”     This passage has several salient points to the issue at hand:      Salvation is certainly by the “grace of God” - it would be foolish and wrong to assume or assert otherwise, cf. Ephesians 2:8-9 .    Salvation has been “brought to all men” - that is, the opportunity to be saved is available to everyone. Yet we also know that not all will be saved- Matthew 7:21 , “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of My Father, who is in heaven.”     So, if salvation is by grace, and is also available to all men, but not everyone will be saved, what determines who is lost and who is saved? Think about the next question carefully, and refer back to Titus 2:12 .     In what form did salvation by God’s grace appear to mankind? The first word of v.12 is “instructing” - God’s gracious provision of salvation appeared to mankind in the form of instructions! The rest of vv.12-14 include instructions for what one needs to do to become acceptable to Jesus, and therefore capable of receiving His redemption.      Thus, those who follow the instructions given by God receive His gracious provision of salvation through Jesus Christ. That means they become “acceptable to Him” through obedience. And those who refuse to heed the instructions, well, 2Thessalonians 2:8-9 says in part that God will deal out “retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. And these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction…” So the choice is evidently ours- we can “become acceptable” to Jesus through obedient faith, or suffer the consequences.  Sounds like a pretty simple choice to me!"],"title":["“Accepting Jesus” or “Becoming Acceptable” to Jesus?"],"_resultNumber":172,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/accepting_jesus_or_becoming_acceptable_to_jesus","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":172},{"body":["I’ve become old enough, cranky enough, and arthritic enough that purchases having anything to do with my person now must have the “ahhh” factor. If I am going to sit in it, lie on it, wear it, use it, or it’s going to otherwise be in direct contact with me, it must have the “ahhh” factor. For example, not too long ago, I decided that I needed a new office chair. I didn’t necessarily dislike the chair I’d had for several years. I bought it when I was having a lot of lower back problems, and it was very supportive. But it didn’t have the “ahhh” factor that had become important to me. So, I took off to Tyler one morning on a quest to find a new chair.  I went straight to a big office supply store, and they had a cornucopia of chair choices. They had chairs that looked old, they had chairs that looked new, they had chairs that they apparently stocked to supply the local mad scientists’ needs for torture devices in their labs (which I didn’t even know Tyler had!), and they had chairs that looked like that if you accidentally to pulled the wrong lever or pushed the right button, they might sprout rocket propulsion jets and blast off into space. I tried them all, but some of them for no longer than it took my posterior to hit bottom and spring right back up again accompanied by, “Oh no- that’ll never do.” Then it happened, I plopped down in one leather-clad big and tall “executive” chair, and was immediately and absolutely compelled to utter a long and audible “Ahhh.” It was an unstoppable involuntary bodily function, no more controllable than a sneeze during a bishop’s prayer. That’s the way the “Ahhh” factor is though- when it is finally achieved or found, vocalization is mandatory.  The “Ahhh” factor is somewhat hard to define. You may not be able to completely understand or describe it, until you experience it. I didn’t really know exactly what I needed or wanted until I sat in the chair that forced the “Ahhh” out of me. It was adjustable to reach the perfect height, its back curved at just the right place to match my back, the armrests were at the perfect height (which eliminated most of the previous candidates), and the memory foam padding was, as Goldilocks would say, “just right.” I didn’t begin my quest with this particular criterion in mind, I just knew my current chair wasn’t all it could or should be. But, when I found one that was, it became obvious.  What has all of this to do with spiritual matters? Anthropology tells us that cultures all over the world and throughout man’s history have worshipped some form of “god.” Why? God created man with an innate knowledge of a “higher power,” and a need to worship “it.” Without knowledge of inspired revelation ( cf. John 1:18; Hebrews 1:3 ), the form of these “gods” and expression of worship varied, and still varies, greatly. But the knowledge and need is there, unless it is suppressed.  Thus, men have searched “  that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us,”  Acts 17:27 . This search, when divine revelation is ignored, is vain and unsatisfying. Oh, we can know that God exists from simply observing the world around us, or even contemplating the presence and wonders of our own bodies, Romans 1:19-20 ; but the “Ahhh” factor of really understanding God and having a real relationship with Him requires the knowledge and application of His revealed word. Hear Romans 10:2-3 regarding Israel on this point, “ For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge. For not knowing about God’s righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.”   Simply put: Unless we are willing to read God’s revealed word, and do what it requires of us, our lives and the conduct of them will never have the “Ahhh” factor. There will always be something missing, though we may not even be sure exactly what it is. Jesus said, “Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven,”  John 3:5 . The Spirit reveals that water baptism is a necessary part of being “born again.” But notice also v.3 , “Unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of heaven.” Unless we read God’s revealed word, and do what it says, “the kingdom of heaven” specifically, and spiritual matters generally, will elude our comprehension, and we will never have the “Ahhh” factor of truly knowing God."],"title":["The “Ahhh” Factor"],"_resultNumber":173,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/the_ahhh_factor","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":173},{"body":["Many times, when engaged in a religious discussion, I have been told, “We just understand the Bible differently.” My response is always pretty much the same, “No, we don’t ‘understand’ it differently- you may ‘understand’ it, and I may ‘misunderstand’ it, or vice versa, but we do not ‘understand’ it differently.” The response I usually get next is a blank look of shock and disbelief. The reason for this is that people in general have either been led to believe, or have come to the erroneous conclusion on their own, that we are free to interpret and practice the Word of God anyway we please. Such is patently not true!  Biblical truth is not relative. No fact is relative. By definition, a “fact” cannot be relative. What this means is that facts are true whether we “understand” and correctly apply them or not. The laws of gravity were true and controlling our world long before Sir Isaac Newton first began to understand and explain them. If some statement is relative, it is not a “fact,” but a theory or opinion. The “fact” is that God’s Word is “truth”- “Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth” ( John 17:17 ); and, “…let God be found true, though every man be found a liar…” ( Romans 3:4 ). Therefore, it cannot be ‘understood differently’! It is either ‘understood,’ or ‘misunderstood.’ Allow me to further illustrate.  If a map is accurate, I can follow it and get to my intended destination. But if I fail to properly read, understand, and follow that map, will I still arrive at the right place? Of course not- I’ll wind up lost! God’s word is a graciously given “map” which leads to heaven. Jesus said, “he who hears My words, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.” ( John 5:24 ) But if I fail to read, understand, and follow the “map” of God’s word, I cannot get to heaven! The map didn’t fail- it was still true and accurate. I just didn’t correctly understand and follow it.  There is, however, one point of this illustration that needs clarification. With our modern system of roads, there are usually several different ways to get to an intended objective. This is  not  so with God’s divine map. Jesus again said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me.” ( John 14:6 ) Peter later added, “And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men, by which we must be saved.” ( Acts 4:12 ) Thus, the “divine map” of God’s word gives but one “way” to get to heaven- the road of hearing and following the words of Jesus! If we fail to “hear” (correctly understand) them, or if we fail to “follow” them, He says we will not attain eternal reward. “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of My Father, who is in heaven.” ( Matthew 7:21 ) We cannot “do” God’s will if we fail to properly understand it. And if we “understand it differently,” one (or both) of us doesn’t really understand it at all!  Over and over in the Gospels, Jesus pleaded with His audiences to “Hear and understand.” ( Matthew 15:10 ; et al ) In the Parable of the Sower, He said the “good soil” was “the man who hears the word and understands it; who indeed bears fruit…” ( Matthew 13:23 ). Folks, we can’t “understand” the Bible differently. Instead, we must study, search, and examine it carefully to come the real meaning, instead of just settling for how we want to “understand” it. Only then can we become united with God, and one another. But as long as we continue to believe we can “understand God’s word differently,” we will never be united with each other, or Him. The Truth is  not  relative- it is truth, and as such, must be properly understood and obeyed to yield its intended fruit of salvation."],"title":["“Understanding” the Bible Differently?"],"_resultNumber":174,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/understanding_the_bible_differently","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":174},{"body":["Benjamin Franklin is quoted as saying, “How many observe Christ’s birthday- how few, His precepts! O, ‘tis easier to keep holidays than commandments.” While this article is not some sort of anti-Christmas tirade, we do need to consider the wise words of Mr. Franklin. He’s right. It is easier to spend more than we can afford lavishing gifts on one another and being nice to one another for a month each year (OK, a few days or a week for some of us!) than it is to truly strive day in and day out to be what Christ would have us to be. In urging the Ephesians to “walk as children of light,” Paul stated what should be the obvious duty of all Christians- “trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.” ( Ephesians 5:8,10 ) I’m afraid that what many of us call “religious service” is actually more about what we want than what the Lord wants. We seem to strive to fit God into what we already desire to do, rather than genuinely attempting to determine from His Word what He desires of us in the area of service. For instance, what does the New Testament say is the truest expression of our love for God and His Son?  Please consider the following passages carefully to determine the answer:   “And why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?”  Luke 6:46    “If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.”  John 14:15    “He who has My commandments, and keeps them, he it is who loves Me; and he who loves Me shall be loved by My Father, and I will love him, and will disclose Myself to him.”  John 14:21    “Jesus answered and said to him, ‘If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him, and make Our abode with him. He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father’s who sent Me’.”  John 14:23-24    “If anyone does not abide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch, and dries up; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it shall be done for you.”  John 15:6-7    “If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; just as I have kept My Father’s commandments, and abide in His love.”  John 15:10    “You are My friends, if you do what I command you.”  John 15:14   We do not prove our love for or to God through man-made ideas of religious service. We prove our love for God in primarily three ways: (1) doing what He says in the New Testament (as seen in the passages above); (2) striving to emulate Him in our thoughts and ways,  “Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children; and walk in love, just Christ also love you, and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma” ( Ephesians 5:1-2 ); and (3) truly loving one another,  “This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you.” ( John 15:12 )  While God’s Word never includes any command of Jesus for us to remember and celebrate His birth ( cp. 1Corinthians 11:23-26 ), it does include many admonitions by Him for us to abide in His word through obedience, to pattern our thoughts and activities after His, and to love one another as He loved us.

The first is “to appease the desires of” ( Webster’s New Collegiate Dict. ), that is, to get what you want. This isn’t biblical contentment, but it is, unfortunately, the practical application for most of us. We think we would be content if we could just have all (or most) of our desires fulfilled. However, even when such occurs, it usually doesn’t work that way.  The second definition of “content” is “to limit (oneself) in requirements, desires, or actions,” ( IBID ). Obviously, this is on the other end of the spectrum. Instead of getting everything you want, this is learning to be happy with what you have. Such is exactly the meaning of the Greek word, autarkeia ( autos, self + arkeo , to be enough), which is translated as “contentment” in 1Timothy 6:6 , “But godliness actually is a means of great gain, when accompanied by contentment .”   The pivot-point between these two opposing definitions is the difference between  wants  and  needs   . The first definition of “contentment” requires the fulfilling of our desires to be reached; while the second one is achieved when our basic necessities are met. Consider the next verses in 1Timothy 6:7-8 , “For we have brought nothing into this world, so we cannot take anything out of it either. And if we have food and covering, with these we shall be content.” I’m not sure how many of us would be content with just enough food to sustain us, and just enough clothing/shelter to protect us. I do know that whoever is able to be content with those bare necessities, would also be content with whatever luxuries God provided without becoming dependent upon them. Paul spoke of this in Philippians 4:11-12 , “Not that I speak from want; for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am. I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need.” Let’s take this basic understanding of “contentment” a bit further.  It occurs to me that the source of many of our spiritual problems is a lack of contentment with God’s provision. Think about it. What causes marital infidelity? Is it not a lack of contentment with the spouse God gave you, 1Corinthians 7:1-5 ? What causes greed? Is it not a lack of contentment with God’s provision of sustaining material things, Matthew 6:25-33 ? What causes most conflicts between us? Isn’t it that we are not content with what we are getting from the other person- whether it’s respect, tolerance, understanding, forgiveness, assistance, etc.? But if, in true contentment, we could obey Philippians 2:2-3 , “Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind let each of you regard one another as more important than himself; do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others,” wouldn’t most of these conflicts disappear?  What about “contentment” in religion? If we would just content ourselves with doing what God said, how God said to do it, wouldn’t that simplify things dramatically? If we were content with Christ’s plan to save through believing ( John 8:24 ), repenting ( Luke 13:3 ), confessing ( Matthew 10:32 ), being baptized for the remission of sins ( 1Peter 3:21 ), and living faithfully to the best of our abilities ( John 14:15 ), then unity could result. If we were content with God’s instructions for simple New Testament worship, which included praying ( 1Timothy 2:8 ), singing ( 1Corinthians 14:15 ), partaking of the Lord’s Supper ( 1Corinthians 11:23-34 ), preaching/studying the word ( Acts 2:42 ), and giving of our means ( 1Corinthians 16:1-2 ), then we could do away with robe-clad choirs, orchestras, dramatic performances, fund-raisers for every kind of activity and function, and all the “special” groups which divide us. Then, we could be together, and simply worship God “in spirit and in truth.” How great is the gain when godliness is accompanied by simple contentment with what God has said, cf.1Timothy 6:6 and 1Peter 4:11 !  It is a wonderful thing to content yourself: with God’s physical provision of life’s necessities; in your relationships with family, friends, and brethren; and with God’s plans of salvation and worship!"],"title":["Contentment"],"_resultNumber":176,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/contentment","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":176},{"body":["Eons ago in High School, I was actually pretty quick and fairly athletic. I played baseball, basketball, and tennis (our school was too small for football). The coach even talked me into running the 100 yard hurdles one year- I won my heat race, but stepped on the line after clearing the last hurdle and was disqualified. But one year was enough for me. Track wasn’t my thing. I didn’t like just running for the sake of running when I could be chasing a ball! Besides, although I was fleet of foot, I hated distance running. Endurance was definitely lacking in me, and I just wasn’t willing to put forth the effort to develop it (which is probably another way of saying I was too lazy).  Biblically, Christianity is compared to running a race, but isn’t a sprint. After rising from the waters of baptism, enthusiasm is often high, and the new convert sprints forth with great dedication and zeal. But when the initial excitement wears thin, or wears off completely, he soon fades and falls from faithfulness. Such is often due to his reasons for “conversion” in the first place. If the decision to become a disciple of Christ was made from a mostly emotional motivation, it is hard to maintain that infatuation high for very long. Such is represented in the Parable of the Sower as those “on the rocky soil…who when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no firm root; they believe for a while, and in time of temptation fall away.” ( Luke 8:13 ) But if the decision to follow Christ instead stemmed from a deeper understanding of God and His will for our lives ( cf. Luke 8:15 ), the long-term goal of heaven is more clearly in mind, and it is easier to “stay the course.” The hare was initially faster, but the tortoise actually won the race.  The Hebrews writer addresses these matters in 12:1 , “Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance, and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us…” Christianity (living the Christian life) is a race, but it is not a sprint. It is a distance race requiring endurance. The usual Greek term in the N.T. translated into our English word “endurance” is defined as “the characteristic of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings,” ( Enhanced Strong’s Lexicon ). Purely emotionally-based attachments to Christ, those which lack true and deeper understanding of His Word and its requirements, almost always lack the endurance necessary to “finish the course” ( cf. 2Timothy 4:7 ).  All of this begs the question: “Must a Christian ‘finish the course’ to receive the prize of heaven?” Let’s let the Bible speak for itself. In Matthew 10:22 , Jesus said, “it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved.” Paul, in 1Corinthians 9:24 , wrote, “Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.” Jesus, again, said in Luke 21:19 , “By your perseverance (or endurance, depending on your translation, PCS) you will win your souls.” Now, have you ever known anyone to win a race that they didn’t finish, or to win one from which they were disqualified for violating the rules (see first paragraph again, as well as 1Corinthians 9:25-27 )? Me either.  The N.T. uses the word “endurance,” or some form of it, some forty times. Why, do you suppose, if the Christian who is “once saved, always saved” is endurance so heavily stressed? Jesus told Christians at Smyrna, “Be thou faithful  unto  death, and I will give you the crown of life.” ( Revelation 2:10 , KJV). He was not telling them to be faithful as long as they lived - though that is also necessary as we’ve seen above. Instead, He was telling them to be faithful in the face of persecution even if it cost them their lives. “Until” is a designation of time, but “unto” is a designation of degree. If Jesus required endurance to the point of death for the Christians of the first century to attain eternal salvation, is any less required of us today? “If we endure, we will also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us.” ( 2Timothy 2:12 ) Please think carefully about these things, and finish the course/race!"],"title":["Endurance"],"_resultNumber":177,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/endurance","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":177},{"body":["Before I was old enough to have better sense, a Jr. High coach talked me into running track. After only one additional year of maturation, I decided that much running should involve chasing a ball, or at least hitting one so someone else had to run after it! But, since I said “yes” when asked, and both ran and jumped fairly well (then!), the 100 yard hurdles became my assigned specialty. I use the term “specialty” very loosely because, as I remember, the little country school I attended might have had one or two broken and discarded hurdles with which to train, such was about the extent of it! Nonetheless, the day of the district meet arrived, and I lined up with the rest of the lads who had doubtless also been duped into competing....  The gun sounded and I was off like a flash- OK, at least a spark. I ran and jumped and ran and jumped and…you get the point- until the finish line was crossed. Though my friends cheered my apparent win of this particular heat race, something was wrong. None of the judges came up to me to secure my name and school affiliation. So, I stood there aimlessly celebrating my feat until I heard one of them say, “Lane #4 (or whatever it was) is disqualified.” It seems that although I cleared all the hurdles cleanly, and finished ahead of all the other skulls full of mush, I had accidently landed on the lane marker when completing one of the jumps. “But it was an accident,” I thought- I didn’t mean to step on the line, nor did I gain any advantage by it. Nonetheless, my day (and track career) was done. I couldn’t win that fifteen-cent blue ribbon everyone else seemed to crave…which didn’t really bother me much at all.  All of that reminiscing was to introduce this: Paul wrote to the Corinthians about competing “according to the rules” in 1Corinthians 9:24ff . The Corinthian brethren were well aware of the illustrations of running and boxing that Paul used since the Isthmian Games were held near there every two years. These contests were the ancient forerunners of our modern Olympics. But Paul has a couple of spiritual applications from these events for the Corinthians that we might also do well to consider.  In vv.24-25a , he focuses on the principle that in order to win, one must compete “according to the rules” - a lesson the introductory story of my disqualification also well illustrates. But his point is that the practice of Christianity has “rules” which must be likewise obeyed in order to receive the ultimate prize of salvation. Desire, intent, and effort are certainly necessary, but are of themselves insufficient. One must also “Run in such a way that you may win,”  v.24b . He further states that competing for the spiritual reward requires that one “exercises self-control in all things,”  v.25a . Believing that you can win, or even that you have won (again, like me in my race), is not the same thing as obeying the rules, nor are they substitutes for it.  In v.25b , Paul highlights the importance of the point of the illustration by saying that in the games, a “perishable wreath” is the prize. But he quickly adds that the Christian race is for the “imperishable” prize of eternal life. This “race” isn’t for the accolades of friends, the personal “thrill of victory” over temporal opponents, a fifteen-cent ribbon, or even for a woven wreath of olive branches that will surely dry and deteriorate overnight. Instead, the prize for running according to (God’s) rules is eternal life. Therefore, one must run this race with the precise purpose of eternal life, v.26 !  In v.27 , Paul also adds a significant application to the illustrations- that of disqualification. Many people have been taught that once a person is “saved,” they can never be “eternally lost.” Aside from the fact that 26 of the 27 books of the New Testament refute this doctrine, it just doesn’t coincide with Paul’s inspired words here. If the “prize” of running the Christian “race” is eternal life, and it surely is, then why is he emphasizing the importance of “self-control” and running “in such a way” (according to God’s rules rather than our own) “that you might win”? Additionally, if a person is “once saved always saved,” why is Paul so concerned with and making every effort to keep from being “disqualified”? The Christian “race” surely can be won- obviously with God’s help and grace, and the imperishable prize of eternal life attained- but one must run in such a way as God determines lest he be disqualified!"],"title":["Winning the Imperishable Wreath or Being Disqualified"],"_resultNumber":178,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/winning_the_imperishable_wreath_or_being_disqualified","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":178},{"body":["How long has it been since you’ve heard those words? They’re rarely spoken anymore. Everyone has someone else to blame, or some mitigating circumstance that somehow removes culpability. But when it comes to sin, there is no one else to blame- “it is my fault”. Here’s why….  1Corinthians 10:12-13 reads, “Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall. No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able; but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, that you may be able to endure it.” This passage clearly places the responsibility for my sin squarely upon me! Let’s break it down to see how.  When it comes to sin, no one is bullet-proof. Everyone is susceptible. That’s what verse 12 said: whoever “thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.” Being overcome by temptation and sinning is not just a possibility, it is a probability. This doesn’t mean we have to sin, just that we do sin. I do, and you do too, and the sooner we admit it, the sooner we can begin to overcome them.    When it comes to sin, I’m not a special case, and neither are you. Our society is plagued by “special case logic.” “My situation” is supposedly different, and therefore the rules that apply to everyone else somehow don’t apply to “me”! But that’s not what God said, nor how He looks at my sin, or yours. Note the passage again, “No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man…” Get that: I am not a “special case” when it comes to sin, and neither are you! We need to stop excusing ourselves and take responsibility for our sins.   When it comes to sin, I have to trust the faithfulness of God. Our passage clearly said that God will not allow me to be tempted beyond what I am able to withstand. God knows me better than I know myself. He knows what I can successfully withstand, and what I cannot bear. So when He says He won’t let me be tempted beyond what I can stand, I need to trust Him- and stop making excuses! “I just couldn’t help myself” is a lie told to feel better about failure. And by the way, with all due credit to Flip Wilson, “The Devil didn’t make me do it” either. I chose to either be ignorant of God’s will, or I chose to disregard God’s will for what I wanted to do, period. We must understand that we have the power to say “No” to temptation, and thereby overcome it. “I can’t” is a lie because God said “You can.”   When it comes to sin, there is always a “right” thing to do. Sometimes we say, “I took the lesser of two evils because that’s all I could do.” Our passage says I’m lying to myself and others if that is what I think. There is always a “right” thing to do because God never leaves us with nothing but “wrong” choices. It said that God would “with the temptation provide a way of escape also…” We tend to think of a way of escape as an “easy way out,” but that is not the meaning here. Looking for, finding, and doing the “right” thing in the face of temptation may indeed be the most difficult, gut-wrenching thing you’ve ever done in your life. But based on the faithful promise of God, the “right” thing is always available to me, and to you. It may be harder than the wrong thing, but it is there none the less- for all of us.  Peter wrote in part, “for by what a man is overcome, by this he is enslaved.” (2Peter 2:19) You and I have a choice: we can keep on denying, excusing, justifying, or otherwise mitigating our sins and responsibility for them, or we can overcome them by accepting responsibility and doing better!"],"title":["It’s My Fault"],"_resultNumber":179,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/its_my_fault","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":179},{"body":["A long-time husband was asked how he and his wife had stayed so happily married for all of those years. He replied that it was easy, explaining that they reached an agreement early in their marriage about who would make the decisions in their home. They concluded that he would make all the “big” ones- like whether or not the U.S. should invade Russia, and she would decide everything else! Life is full of choices- too many at times. But the really “big” choices are much more limited with regard to selections than the smaller ones. In fact, the biggest choice of all only has two options from which to pick: We either believe God exists, or we don’t- everything else kind of follows after this one.  Consider the beginning of the world, for instance. Either we believe that matter is eternal and created the mind of man- Evolution; or we believe that the Mind (of God) is eternal and created matter- Creation. One believes that dead matter created living minds, and the other believes that a living Mind created all matter. The scientific Law of Biogenesis states that “Life begets life.” The biblical record supports this conclusion, “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” ( Genesis 1:1 ) On the sixth day of creation, God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures…Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness…And God created man in His own image….male and female He created them.” ( Genesis 1:24-27 ) Each of us must choose to believe that life came from non-living matter, or that life came from the living God. All other choices we make in life originate from this one “big” one.   If we choose to believe that man is the product of evolution, then our world view becomes very much “man-centered.” If man is but the pinnacle product of primordial soup that was energized to life by an unknown cause, then he truly is the “Master” of his own destiny because he’s the top of the heap- the highest evolved creature. In this view, man seeks all of the answers to life’s questions within himself. He also, if this is his choice about origins, will come to believe: that there are no absolute “truths” regarding anything; that everything is therefore subjective to his own determinations; that positive attitudes and personal self-worth are paramount objectives for all humanity; and that secular education is that which allows mankind to overcome all that plagues human existence. These conclusions logically and naturally follow when man chooses to believe that he is the evolutionary product of lifeless eternal matter becoming a finite living being.  Other the other hand, if man chooses to believe that he is the creation of an eternal, living God who imbued him with an immortal soul, then his whole world view is very different, and becomes “God-centered.” Man is, in this perspective, no longer a mere highly-evolved animal, but the crown-jewel of all of God’s creation- the only member of it in whom God placed part of His own immortality: a soul , Genesis 2:7 ! God gave man something that would cause him to be able to think and reason on a higher and nobler plane; something that would enable him to comprehend (at least in part) and worship his Creator; and something that would allow him to be able to live beyond the tenure of his earthly existence! This belief, if chosen, also has logical and natural conclusions. If man adopts this view, then he will also come to understand: that he is not the originator of “right” and “wrong,” but that his Creator has the power, by right of creation, to determine such for him ( Psalm 15 ); that his self-worth is directly tied to the value his Creator placed, and places, upon him ( Romans 5:8; 2Timothy 2:20-21 ); that understanding God and His revealed Word is more important than anything man can discover or teach himself ( Jeremiah 10:23; John 12:48 ); and that righteous obedience to God is the answer to life’s plagues and difficulties ( Proverbs 11:4-6; 14:34 ).  Now, do you see how everything else flows logically, naturally, and conclusively from this one “big” choice? Choose wisely my friends- all of this life, and the next, hang in the balance."],"title":["Choices: The Big One"],"_resultNumber":180,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/choices_the_big_one","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":180},{"body":["By “attitude” I refer to your overall outlook on things, and your self-perception. The proverbial writer penned of mankind, “For as he thinks within himself, so his he.” ( Proverbs 23:7 ) What God’s wisdom seems to be telling us is that we determine who we are. Thus, “sour” people are that way because they choose to be so; and conversely, “happy” people are that way because they choose to be so. While we may accept these things to be generally true of others, we often fail to see the impact of them in ourselves....  Think about this way: do others cause you to be either happy or sad? Oh sure, there are times when others say or do things which affect all of us, at least temporarily. But is your day to day perspective determined by what someone else does? If so, you are what could be termed reactionary- that is, you are reacting to stimuli others are giving you. And unfortunately, you are allowing others to influence who you are and how you act. Perhaps an illustration will help.  A man pauses at the door, steps aside, and opens the door for female who was also approaching the door to allow her to enter first- or at least he thought that’s what he was doing. She abruptly stops, looks him square in the eye, and begins to berate him for being a “chauvinist.” She told him that she was a mature, accomplished woman and that she prided herself on not being ‘dependent’ on anyone- especially a man! He was somewhat shocked, but she wasn’t finished. “Did you think I was such a ‘helpless female’ or a ’lady’ that I couldn’t even open a door for myself?” He calmly responded, “Ma’am, I opened the door for you not because of who or what you were, but because who and what I am.” She promptly stomped past by him without another word.  She was reactionary- her feelings and attitudes were completely determined by what someone else did, which she chose to perceive as an insult. He, on the other hand, acted based on who and what he was. He chose to be polite, humble, and gracious because that’s who he was inside, not because of who or what someone else was, or wasn’t. Which one of these two do you suppose had a “good” day?  Now let’s get personal. Do you find that your attitude is dependent on what others do? Do you react to the bad attitudes and actions of others in kind, or the way Jesus commanded in Luke 6:27-28 , “love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.” If you’re tempted to reply, “Well I’m just not made that way,” then listen closely to what you’re thinking- that you’re not “made” that way. Who made you? God did. Doesn’t He know how to love and treat well those who despise and mistreat Him? The crucifixion of Jesus provides the answer! Didn’t God make us in His own image? Sure did, Genesis 1:26 . Did He “make” you that different from Himself? Hardly! So how did you come to be a reactionary who bases who you are and how you conduct yourself on what others do? Everyone chooses who they are and how they conduct themselves.  Think back to Cain and Abel, Genesis 4:1-15 . Abel listened to God and acted “by faith” in offering His sacrifice ( see Hebrews 11:4 〉 Romans 10:17 ). Cain, on the other hand, made a sacrifice to God which was not according to the command, but expected Him to accept it anyway (don’t ignore this lesson either). When God rejected Cain’s faithless sacrifice, instead of repenting and doing right, Cain “became very angry and his countenance (facial expression/composure) fell.” ( Genesis 4:5 ) But here’s the point: God said to Cain, “If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up? But if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and its desire is for you, but you must master it.” ( Genesis 4:7 ) Cain chose the latter option. He chose to stew in his anger until he rose up and killed his brother. If he had chosen “to do right,” his attitude about himself, his situation, and others would have been very different.  We choose who we are, and how we conduct ourselves. We can chose to  act  based on who and what we are from the Word of God which we have implanted in hearts, or we can choose to  react  to who and what others are- but the choice is still ours."],"title":["Is Your Attitude Circumstantial"],"_resultNumber":181,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/is_your_attitude_circumstantial","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":181},{"body":["We live in a world where details matter. Specificity is a “must” in most facets of our lives. Accuracy in detail is seemingly always required. Some of this is the product of living in a litigious environment, and some of it is the result of living with close tolerances of time and money. All of which has made details vitally important in virtually every part of our lives- the details matter to us today; and those who don’t manage the those details well, seemingly get left behind, or out. Most folks realize this, and have thus become “detail-oriented” people. But here’s a strange contrast: while we have become  more  “detail-oriented” in most areas of our lives, we have also become  less  “detail-oriented” in our religious devotion.  Perhaps we’re just “detailed-out” by the time we get to God. Surely God should take priority over all the other details of our lives, but it doesn’t always happen that way. Unfortunately, God is often left with the non-specific “leftovers” of our otherwise “detail-dominated” lives.  The thing that really bothers me about all of this lack of attention to details in our religious devotion is that God is Himself “detail-oriented.” He was very specific in telling Noah exactly how to build the ark, and what provisions and animals to put in it ( Genesis 6:13-21 ). Noah followed God’s detailed instructions to the letter, “Thus Noah did; according to all that God had commanded him, so he did.” ( Genesis 6:22 ) Because of Noah’s faithful “attention to detail” in his obedience, he, his family, and the animals were saved from the flood, Hebrews 11:7 .  Likewise, Moses was given very detailed instructions on how to build the tabernacle (the temporary “tent of meeting” God used to commune with the Israelites during the time of their wilderness wanderings). Hebrews 8:5 records the specificity of God’s command, “just as Moses was warned by God, when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, ‘See,’ He says, ‘That you make all things according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain.’” The “details” mattered to God.  Things didn’t change in the New Testament either. Note the apostle Paul’s inspired warning to the Philippian church, “Brethren, join in following my example and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us (meaning, “the apostles”), Philippians 3:17 . Details still mattered to God. The abundant grace afforded through Christ did not change the fact that God gave specific instructions that He expected to be fully obeyed in order to enjoy continued fellowship with Him. The New Testament is the Law of God for all people today; cf. Hebrews 1:1-2 , so the details and specificity of His commands from it apply equally to us now.  So how is it that many today believe and espouse, “It really doesn’t matter what you believe as long as you’re honest and sincere”? That just doesn’t seem to match God’s “detail-oriented” nature and commands, does it? While God’s commands for us are not difficult to comprehend or obey, they are specific, and the details still matter. Take the conversion of Saul of Tarsus, for example ( cf. Acts 9:1-22; 22:3-15 ). He saw the Lord Jesus on the road to Damascus, believed Jesus with all his heart, had a personal conversation with Him, and fasted and prayed for three days afterwards, but still had to meet God’s specific requirement of baptism in order to be saved. How do I know that? Read Acts 22:16 , where, after Paul had seen and experienced and done all of the above, he was told, “And now why do you delay? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.” The details of Saul’s conversion were important to the Lord, and should be to us because we’re saved in the exact same way.  Like Saul, we’re not saved through “seeing” the Lord; or through just “believing” in Him; or through having personal conversation/contact with Him; or through fasting and prayer- but through obeying the specific details of His commands. Those other things were important parts of the process, but Saul still needed baptism to be saved. He didn’t quibble, excuse himself, or point to his previous experiences and prior obedience for justification. He just got up and did what God said- because the details mattered to God. They still do, “He that believes and is baptized shall be saved.” ( Mark 16:16 )  We can’t believe and practice anything we want to call “religion” and expect God to accept it as such. We have o do what He said, how He said- because the details matter to Him. They did for Noah; they did for Moses; they did for Saul; and they do for us!"],"title":["Details Matter"],"_resultNumber":182,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/details_matter","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":182},{"body":["Have you ever been in such a painful predicament that death seemed like the only hope of relief? Elijah once expressed a similar sentiment in 1Kings 19:4 , “It is enough; now, O Lord, take my life….”. The prophet came to this point of utter exasperation for reasons he proffered in v.10 , “the sons of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, torn down Thine altars and killed Thy prophets with the sword. And I alone am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.” Elijah viewed his situation as hopeless, and apparently preferred that the Lord take his life instead of his enemies doing so. But, as is the case with most things we humans see as hopeless, he was wrong. The Lord tells him that it is not nearly as bad as he thinks- that are yet 7,000 in Israel who do not worship the idol Baal ( v.17 ), and also gives him a set of instructions telling to him to basically get up and get busy ( vv.15-17 ). There are apparent lessons for all of us in this story, but let’s get back to our original question, “Have you ever been in such a painful predicament that death seemed like the only hope of relief?”  I’ve been close to this situation- close enough that I was actually OK with dying “today ” if such was the Lord’s will. Obviously, it is not a pleasant place to be physically, but it is spiritually liberating. Once you reach the point of actually relinquishing the stranglehold we try to maintain on physical life, and trust God completely with your physical and spiritual existence, you become free not only from the constraints of “life” that death holds over you, but you are also released from the shackles of sin to which the fear of death holds the key ( cf. Hebrews 2:15 and Romans 8:15 ).  I’m not at all suggesting that salvation is achieved through such a mental and spiritual epiphany alone- just that it is realized in a way that perhaps did not fully dawn on us at the initial point of our surrender to belief in Christ and our rebirth in Him through baptism. In this regard at least, it seems suppose matures and comes to full fruition as does our faith and trust- at the sunset of life, or at we at least perceive to be our end. It is then that “salvation” becomes a matter of complete faith and trust in God in a way that it has never been previously.  But for salvation, or even this more complete realization of it, to mature into complete faith and trust, it must have a birth- a beginning. Often this point of origin takes root in utter despair and the recognition of our complete dependence upon God. The prodigal son of Luke 15 did not “come to his senses” until his wallowing in the muck and mire of immorality had exhausted all his resources and completely enslaved him. Such is the nature of sin. It incarcerates us in our own selfish desires. Emancipation from this enslavement to sin involves execution. In fact, execution is the only exit to spiritual incarceration. Let me explain with the help of Romans 6 .  Paul wrote that when we use our bodies (and lives) for selfish and sinful purposes, we become “slaves to impurity and lawlessness, resulting in further lawlessness,”  v.19 . This pervasive nature of sin entangles us to the point that we thus become “slaves to sin,”  v.20 . From this incarceration we cannot free ourselves, but there are things we must do to allow God to extricate us. Note some earlier verses in chapter six which outline them. We must become dead to sin,  v.2 . How? We die to sin by being “baptized into Christ Jesus” and being thus “baptized into His death,”  v.3 ; but this death is not just Christ’s- it must necessarily be ours also. Note carefully vv.6-7 , “knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, that our body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin; for he who died is freed from sin.” Through baptism, we die with and are buried with Christ so that we might be freed from sin. We are emancipated from spiritual incarceration through execution- the crucifixion of our selfishly sinful selves that we might be resurrected to a new and free life in Jesus!  Physical death can be a relief from suffering, but only if the soul has already been freed from its imprisonment in sin through the execution (by crucifixion) of our old self of sin. Now, are you ready to die physically “today” because you have put to death your man of sin? Or, are you still clinging helplessly and hopelessly to physical life because it is all that you have?"],"title":["Spiritual Incarceration’s One Exit: Emancipation through Execution"],"_resultNumber":183,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/spiritual_incarcerations_one_exit_emancipation_through_execution","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":183},{"body":["Consider this quote from Marion Mitchell Morrison (1971): “Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. Comes into us at midnight very clean. It’s perfect when it arrives and puts itself in our hands. It hopes we’ve learned something from yesterday.”  There is a lot of truth in those words. They are engraved on his headstone. Though Mr. Morrison’s words, they are not the ones he suggested for his epithet- that would have instead read, “Feo, Fuerto y Formal” (which he said meant “ugly, strong and dignified”). By the way, you probably know Marion Mitchell Morrison better by his stage name, John Wayne.  The “Duke” (so nicknamed as a child by a local fireman whom he passed on the way to school each day- it was actually “Little Duke” then, as he never went anywhere without his huge Airedale Terrier, “Duke”) was both wrong and right about “tomorrow”- as many of us are about many things in life. He was right when he spoke of the perfection of tomorrow. Each one does arrive as “today” in a perfect blank canvas form; one on which we sling our own mundane and selfish dirt of the day, or paint a masterpiece of service to others and devotion to God. Each tomorrow arrives as “today” fresh, clean, and empty- awaiting our decisions on how to utilize it. And Duke was also right about the hopes of tomorrow. Hope does, or it at least can, spring eternal with each new tomorrow. The trouble and trials of today and yesterday have not sullied tomorrow, unless we cause them to do so. And Jesus said not to do that, “Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow; for tomorrow will care for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.” (Matthew 6:34) Each new day has the hope of improvement as a result of the experiences of being another day older- which is supposed to make us wiser and therefore better able to spend this tomorrow that has now become “today.” God expects us to manifest improvement with each tomorrow He grants, “As a result, we are no longer children….but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him, who is the head, even Christ” (Ephesians 4:14-15).  But the Duke was wrong about one thing in his quote. “Tomorrow” is not the most important thing in life. It can’t be, if we live right. With no disrespect meant to Mr. Wayne, God said in James 4;13-14, “Come now, you who say, ‘Today or tomorrow, we shall go to such and such city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.’ Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.” The point is that none is promised tomorrow (see the parable Jesus taught on this point in Luke 12:16-21). The uncertainty of tomorrow even existing necessarily means that if it is made “the most important thing in life” then it is certain that “today” is not being properly spent! Consider also Hebrews 3:13, “But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called, ‘Today,’ lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.” Today is what we have, and we need to use it to “...lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven…” rather than spending it to pursue only things that are temporal, finite, and destined to destruction, cf. Matthew 6:19-21. Another famous fellow once sang “If tomorrow never comes…” It’s a great question.  If “tomorrow” never comes, are you comfortable with your standing before God “today”? Think about it carefully, because as good and hopeful as “tomorrow” can be, it may not come for you, me, or any of us. So don’t plan to fill your tomorrow(s) with what should be done spiritually today!"],"title":["“Tomorrow”"],"_resultNumber":184,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/tomorrow","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":184},{"body":["I am a Preacher- not a Psychologist, Psychiatrist, Politician, or Policeman. My job is not easy, but it is fairly straightforward. I attempt to e ducate folks on what the Bible (and therefore God) says, and e ncourage them as best I can to do what it says. But it is not within my purview to e nforce the Bible. I couldn’t even if I wanted to do so. People must be drawn rather than driven to obedience- hence the emphasis on educating and encouraging instead of enforcing . So my purpose in broaching the subject of alcoholic spirits is not to (en)force my personal feelings about the matter on anyone. Instead, I’ll tell you some of what the Bible says regarding the subject. But really, my ultimate purpose in this article is to get you to think about the comparison posed in the title.   The New Testament is the law to which Christians today are actually subject. The Law of Moses (or Old Testament from Exodus through Malachi ) was a law given by God only to Israelites who lived between the time of Moses and the death of Christ. Since that time, all men are subject to the Law of Christ contained in the New Testament, Hebrews 9:15-17 . But throughout the Bible, “drunkenness” is universally condemned as sinful (see Genesis 9:21 ; Proverbs 20:1 and Ephesians 5:18a ). At this point, some may wisely ask, “Are there other forms of partaking alcoholic spirits that are condemned?” Since the New Testament is the law of God we are currently under, let’s take a look at what it has to say.    1Peter 4:3 , “For the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness , carousals , drinking parties , and abominable idolatries.” Since our interest at this point is relative to alcoholic spirits, we’ll forgo the part about sensuality, lusts, and abominable idolatries, to consider drunkenness, carousals, and drinking parties instead. First, “drunkenness” is again condemned as sinful. The Greek (the original language of the New Testament) word which was translated as drunkenness is the term “oinophlugia,” and literally means “wine overflowing.” That needs no further explanation since we’ve already seen that drunkenness is always condemned by God. But the second word of that string is “carousals.” It comes from the original term “komos.” Komos means reveling , rioting , and carousing - a letting loose with drink, if you will. This use of alcoholic spirits is also condemned. The third consideration from the verse is “drinking parties.” This is translated from the Greek term “potos”- which literally refers to a “banqueting” or “drinking party/contest.” Clearly again, this use of alcoholic spirits are forbidden by God.    So, to summarize thus far, drunkenness is sinful. A letting loose and/or carousing drinking is wrong. And, a drinking party or contest is likewise a violation of God’s law. While there are many other things that could be added from the Word of God about the consumption of alcoholic spirits, it is hoped these will give you a starting point for further personal study. But think a step further with me.     Ephesians 5:18 reads, “And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit ,”. Do you realize that this is at least the third time in Scripture that drunkenness (being filled with alcoholic spirits ) is somehow compared with being filled with the Spirit (meaning the Holy Spirit )? Hannah, when she prayed to herself, was accused of being drunk in 1Samuel 1:12-15 . The Apostles, on the Day of Pentecost, when “filled with the Holy Spirit,” were likewise accused of being drunk, Acts 2:4-13 . And now in Ephesians 5:18 , drunkenness is again compared in some way to being Spirit-filled . Why is this? What is the comparison between these two activities that would appear to be so diametrically opposed?    When someone is drunk with alcoholic spirits , they began to do things they don’t do normally or naturally- like think they can sing , or dance , or fight , or become irresistibly attractive to the opposite sex , or…well, you get the picture. Herein lies to the connection to being Spirit-filled:  it likewise causes us to think and do things that are against our normal human nature- only in a good and godly way! Go back to the text of Ephesians 5:18 and realize that the sentence condemning drunkenness but commending being filled with the Spirit doesn’t end with that verse. In fact, the next three verses identify three things that being filled with the Spirit cause us to do that we might not normally: (1) Sing-  “speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord”  v.19 ; (2) Be Thankful-  “always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father”  v.20 ; and (3) Subject Ourselves to One Another-  “and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.”     The servant of God who is filled with the Spirit doesn’t say, “Oh, I can’t sing praises to God- I’ll leave that to others,” he sings from the heart to his Lord. The servant of God who is filled with the Spirit isn’t ungrateful and unappreciative, but instead constantly thanks God for all the blessings He provides. And the servant of God who is filled with the Spirit isn’t selfish, arrogant, or domineering, he is willing to subject himself to others for his good, their good, and the good of the kingdom of God. These things may not be “normal” or “natural” attitudes and actions for us all-too-human beings. But for those who are becoming “partakers of the divine nature” ( 2Peter 1:4 ) by trusting and doing those things the Spirit tells us in the New Testament, thus making us led by and filled with the Spirit , it is oh so much better than being “drunk with wine” and doing stupid sinful stuff that brings only condemnation from God!"],"title":["Alcoholic Spirits and The Spirit"],"_resultNumber":185,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/alcoholic_spirits_and_the_spirit","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":185},{"body":["The Jewish leaders of Jesus’ day were guilty of attempting to make serving God more difficult than it should have been. Of them and this tendency, Jesus said, “… they tie up heavy loads, and lay them on men’s shoulders…”  Matthew 23:4 . Why would religious leaders of any period want to make it more difficult than God does to be considered “faithful”?  From v.2 we learn that “The scribes and Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses”- meaning that they had taken upon themselves a professorial role. Those who read the Law of Moses in the synagogue typically stood to do so ( Luke 4:16 ), but then sat in an elevated chair to expound upon it ( Luke 4:20-21ff ). The impurity in purpose of the scribes and Pharisees becomes clear, not only from the “heavy loads” they placed upon the people while being unwilling to abide by the same themselves, but also from v.5 which adds, “they do all their deeds to be noticed by men…” Their intent was not to teach and explain God’s Law, but to elevate themselves by making obedience more difficult for everyone else! Perhaps this is the motivation for similarly misguided attempts to make spirituality harder than it should be currently.  Acceptability to God has two essential parts: 1) knowledge of what God requires; and 2) compliance. James 4:17 puts it succinctly, “Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do, and does not  do it , to him it is sin.” Now, if either the knowingor the doingof what God expects is difficult, then faithfulness is likewise going to be hard. But, if neither understanding nor following God’s commands is especially complicated or strenuous, then being faithful should be fairly attainable for everyone. Let’s give these matters a “look-see” from the New Testament.  What about salvation? Is it difficult to either comprehend or accomplish what Jesus said was necessary in order to be saved? “He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved; but he who has disbelieved shall be condemned,”  Mark 16:16 . That’s not too tough. In fact, one must have “help” to misunderstand Jesus’ simply stated formula: Belief + Baptism = Salvation. Since baptism without belief means you just got wet rather than saved, there is no need to restate the second requirement of baptism. In other words, if one doesn’t believe, there is certainly no reason to baptize him, and it wouldn’t do any good if you did so.  But what about doing the right thing(s) after you’ve become a Christian- surely that’s hard, right? Let me ask a question, and be honest with yourself: “How many of the things you do which are wrong, do you know to be wrong when you do them?” Pretty much everyone in control of their faculties knows that it is wrong: to lie and cheat, Ephesians 4:25 ; to steal, Ephesians 4:28 ; to harm or hurt others, Ephesians 4:26,29 ; to get drunk, Ephesians 5:18 , or to have sex with someone to whom they are not married, Ephesians 5:3-5 . We may try to repress this knowledge, or to in some way excuse ourselves from the guilt it implies, but we know these things are wrong- even if we don’t know the location of the specific passages which prove it. Knowing the right thing to do isn’t, therefore, hard.  So, if knowing the right things to do isn’t hard, surely doing them must be, right? Again, let me ask a question: “If, when you did what you already knew was wrong, you really wanted to do what was right instead, couldn’t you have done so?” Sure, we all could have done what we knew to be right- if such had been what we really wanted to do. Therefore, the “hard part” wasn’t in the actual keeping of the command either, was it? Just in case you’re keeping score, 1John 5:3 says so, “For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome.”  “Baros,” the Greek word translated here as “burdensome,” means “heavy in weight.”  See? Doing the right things isn’t really hard at all- either in the  knowing  or the  doing  parts, if we just get our “want to” lined out. When we “want to” do the right thing, learning the right thing(s) is as simple as opening a New Testament and reading. And when we “want to” do the right thing, and know what it is, then doing it is easy. Now, how’s your “want to,” or, your heart? Does it “want to” be pleasing to God ( cf. Ephesians 5:10 )? Then get busy- it really isn’t hard!"],"title":["Doing the Right Things Is Not That Hard"],"_resultNumber":186,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/doing_the_right_things_is_not_that_hard","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":186},{"body":["I have said it so often, others have begun quoting me back to me- but I still believe that “The greatest power of the human mind is the ability to justify self” is absolutely true. We can always find a way to justify doing what we really want to do- even if we profess it to be wrong in most “other cases.” The underlying cause of this ability often has to do with self-perception. We just see ourselves differently than we really are. Our self-perception is, therefore, skewed.  Because of this distorted view, we tend to think we’re the exception to the rule(s)- that they somehow just don’t apply to us. James 1:23-24 addresses this point: “For if any one is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror; for once he has looked at himself and gone away, he had immediately forgotten what kind of person he was.” The Greek word here translated into our English word “forgotten” does often mean “to forget” (as in Matthew 16:5 where the disciples “forgot” to buy bread). But it also can mean to “neglect” or “no longer care for” (as in Hebrews 13:16 where Christians are urged not to “neglect” doing good and sharing). Is James therefore saying that the person he is describing is simply absent-minded, or that he chooses to ignore what he saw when looking in the mirror? Given our human tendency to justify ourselves, I think James is saying that this person chose to “neglect” or “no longer care for” the accurate reflection of the mirror. Then, after walking away from the truth-telling mirror, he simply chooses to accept the image that he prefers of himself. But let’s take this a step or two further.  We must also realize that the truth-telling mirror to which James refers is the word of God. The context (of vv.23-24 ) demands this understanding. Back in v.18 he spoke of “the word of truth,” and again in v.21 , “the word implanted”. More immediately to our passage, v.22 sets the stage for our verses this way, “But prove yourselves doers of the word , and not merely hearers who delude themselves .” Two points are very clear from this verse: 1) the word of God is the mirror which gives us an accurate representation of ourselves, if we will look at and listen to it; and, 2) if we don’t   do  what that word says, we are merely deluding ourselves about who and what we think we are. Sure, we can choose to ignore what this window-to-our-soul mirror tells us for our own preferred view of ourselves, but the real problem is that God doesn’t judge us by our own standards. Jesus said, “He who rejects Me, and does not receive My sayings, has one who judges him; the word I spoke is what will judge him at the last day.” ( John 12:48 )  To really have a clear view of ourselves, we must look into God’s word to see what He expects of us, and act accordingly. Please consider carefully 1John 2:3-5 on this point, “And by this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments. The one who says, ‘I have come to know Him,’ and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him; but whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God has been truly perfected.” Although we may profess great love for God and His Son, such is not enough unless it motivates us to obedience. Jesus said, “If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.” ( John 14:15 )  If we say we love Jesus, and don’t do what He commanded, it sounds like we might be just the person in the mirror of whom James was speaking. Pray for “divine sight”- the ability to see yourself the way God does. Next, open your New Testament and read it so that you can see yourself accurately. Then, get busy becoming the person He expects you to be- a lovingly obedient child!"],"title":["The Person in the Mirror"],"_resultNumber":187,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/the_person_in_the_mirror","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":187},{"body":["If you haven’t noticed the extraordinary amount of tissues being used lately (due to allergies), or the beauty of the Bradford Pear and Red Bud trees beginning to display their beautiful bouquets, spring is upon us. Soil is being turned and tilled for delicate green promises of future goodness. Seeds are being meticulously pushed into what is hoped to be fertile soil. And we’ve had some of those warm, sunny afternoons that make a man think about dusting off his fishing rod, and perhaps buying some “sure thing” lures- you know, the ones that are probably designed more to catch men than fish!  The signs are everywhere, at least to those who long and look for them, for the “renewal” of spring. Oh sure, we’ll still have some of those fronts that blow through with annoying turbulence as winter fights its inevitable surrender. But as the earliest signs of spring clarion its coming, there are spiritual lessons to be discerned. The people of Jesus’ day claimed to be able to discern signs and thereby predict the weather. He referenced this in Matthew 16:1-2 to teach them of more important things, “When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’ And in the morning, ‘There will be a storm today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ Do you know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but cannot discern the signs of the times?” His point was that those claiming such abilities in regard to purely physical things ought to have more spiritual understanding- perhaps we should also.  When we begin to observe the first hints of spring, we prepare and plant to have a summer of bountiful harvest. But these things take preparation, planting, tending, and patience to achieve. So too, our “planting” and “harvesting” for the Lord require the same elements of dedication.  We have to “till” the soil of the hearts of men by living before them lives worthy of emulation. In other words, we strive to prepare their hearts for the word of God by first “showing” them its fruits in our own lives. After all, if we aren’t willing practice what we preach, or if what we preach is impotent to produce a bountiful harvest in our lives, why should they listen to us when we tell them about the wondrous power of God’s word? Jesus put it this way: “Let your lights shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father in heaven.” ( Matthew 5:16 ) I know I’m “mixing metaphors” (seed, fruit, and harvest vs. shining lights), but hope you get the point.  But just “tilling the soil” has limited value unless “seed” is actually planted. The “seed” is the Word of God, cf. Luke 8:11b . God’s power to save is certainly enhanced by godly lives which demonstrate it, but the true power resides in the “seed” itself- not in the foliage and flowers it produces. This means we must teach people the gospel. We can’t just give them a good example to admire (as one might a flower), we have to put the “seed” in their hearts so that it can produce a harvest of salvation in their lives too. It is the “word implanted which is able to save your  souls” ( James 1:21b ), not someone else’s godly example.  As all farmers and gardeners know, patience is also required. When we have properly “tilled” the soil of someone’s heart with a good example, and when we have “implanted the good seed of the Word of God” in their hearts, what remains to be done is “tending” and “time.” We have to continue to be concerned about their souls enough to stay involved, and be patient enough to wait for power of the seed to break through the hardened crusts of sin- which sometimes takes time. “Be patient, therefore, brethren….Behold the farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it, until it gets the early and late rains.” ( James 5:7 )  Yep, the changing of the seasons and other wonders of our physical creation can teach us much about our spiritual duties and relationship to God….if we are longing and looking for the “signs”!"],"title":["Spring is “Springing”"],"_resultNumber":188,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/spring_is_springing","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":188},{"body":["On September 12, 1962, at Rice University Stadium in Houston, TX, President John F. Kennedy gave his famous “Moon Speech.” In this historic discourse, the President announced, “We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard...  because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.” This speech spurred national pride in our space program, and set a very difficult goal for NASA with what some undoubtedly saw as an impossible timetable. But the objective was not impossible- it was “hard,” but not unattainable.  Some also view an eternal home in heaven as unattainable. Jesus’ own disciples, at least at one point, seemed to share this perspective. After Jesus had told them of the difficulty of “entering the kingdom of God,” they responded with what was evidently to them a question without an answer, “Then who can be saved?” His response to their question is of paramount importance, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” ( Matthew 19:24-26 ) It is “impossible” to reach the eternal abode of heaven  withou  t God. But  with    God, this seemingly unfeasible goal becomes possible- difficult, but not impossible.  Many today preach a “cheap” and “easy” salvation. While such may be popular, it is not biblical. Consider again the words of Jesus Himself, this time from Matthew 7:13-14 , “Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide, and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter by it. For the gate is small, and the way is narrow that leads to life, and few are those who enter by it.” The narrowness of both the gate (initial point of entry) and the way (path to the objective) indicate a difficulty of reaching heaven in comparison to the wideness (and therefore ease )of both the gate and way which leads to eternal destruction. It is indeed interesting that the Savior follows these words immediately in the text of Matthew 7:15ff with a warning against “false prophets”. Surely they are those who oppose and contradict His Words!  The next logical question from these things thus becomes: “What makes the way to heaven hard?” Here are a few suggestions.   The way to heaven is “hard” because it requires faith.   Faith requires assurance and conviction regarding “things not seen,”  Hebrews 11:1 . It is easy to walk (traverse the path of life) by sight, but much more difficult to “walk by faith,”  2Corinthians 5:7 . And yet, faith is the only way that is pleasing to God, “without faith it is impossible to please Him,”  Hebrews 11:6 .     The way to heaven is “hard” because it requires obedience. Faith is not just believing in Jesus - even “the demons also believe, and shudder,”  James 2:19 . True, biblical, saving faith includes obedience, “Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself…You see that a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone…so also faith without works is dead,”  James 2:17,24,26 . Eternal salvation is not attained on the basis of what we know, feel, or experience, though all of these are included. These are relatively easy- but faithfully and consistently “doing the right thing” is admittedly hard,  James 4:17 .   The way to heaven is “hard” because it requires us to think, feel, and act like God. Perhaps the clearest explanation of this principle can be found in Matthew 5:44-45 , “But I (Jesus) say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you; in order that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven…” Did you get that? If we want to be God’s children, we must love those who hate us, and do good to them that do evil to us. Folks, such is not easy- it’s hard! But it is also necessary to attain heaven.  These few suggestions have only “scratched the surface” of the topic. But lest we become discouraged, and start to think heaven is unreachable, remember Matthew 19:26 , “With men it is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” Do those things which allow you to be “with God” both now and forever!","It’s been an uphill struggle, but he is now on his way.

It may be a subversive plot by the mechanized underworld to take over us! For instance, can’t get your car out of “Park” until you put your foot on the brake? That’s a safety switch added to keep you from backing through the garage door (at least in theory). Can’t get your car to start after backing into a light pole in the parking lot? It’s likely the inertia fuel safety switch in the trunk that shuts off the fuel pump after an accident (it has a button on the top you press to reset it). Your blender won’t blend unless you twist the handle while pressing the button? It’s the safety switch designed to prevent you from being able to turn it on with one hand while the other hand is inside the blender. Your riding lawnmower dies every time you hit a big bump? There’s a safety switch under the seat that is deactivated when your weight is even temporarily or slightly lifted from the seat. It’s supposed to keep you from getting your toes masticated under the mower deck when you hop down to pick up that stick or ball. And on, and on, and on it goes.  Some of the safety switches are good ideas that save lives, limbs, and property; but some of them are, well, just attempts to “idiot-proof” tools that make using them aggravating for the rest of us. (And to prevent lawyers from having too much to do!) Thus, the riding lawnmower I crawled on one day that had four different safety switches on it- putting it in reverse while the cutting blades were engaged would kill the motor, quickly got  “rewired!”  Although it wasn’t mine, after I finished, it “worked” much better.  As frustrating as some of the ridiculous safety switches are, wouldn’t be great to have a few “spiritual safety switches” available to us? For instance, what if we could install some sort of safety switch to our tongues to prevent them from “going in gear” before our brains were “on the brake” to prevent runoff, cf. James 3:1-12 ? That would be helpful! Or, what if we had an inertia safety switch to keep us from going on from one “wreck” in our lives to another without taking the time to find and press the “reset” button of wisdom, James 3:13 ; 4:2 ? Such would certainly prevent a lot of spiritual disasters! Certainly we could all use a safety switch to keep us from having our “hands” in dangerous spiritual situations, 1Thessalonians 4:11 . And, who couldn’t benefit from a safety switch to protect our “toes” from the repercussions of our own careless thoughts, words, and deeds, Matthew 18:8 ; 1Corinthians 12:15 ? Yep, “spiritual safety switches” would be a lot more helpful, and a lot less aggravating, than many of the physical ones we encounter every day!  The good news is that these “spiritual safety switches” have already been invented, are readily available, and are already in use in some (models of) people. What are these “spiritual safety switches” ? Please consider the following.  The Word of God is a “spiritual safety switch.” When properly installed (in the heart, James 1:21 ), it provides us “all things that pertain to life and godliness,”  2Peter 1:3 . This doesn’t mean God will tell us what make or color of car to buy- instead, through the New Testament, He tells us how to live in holiness so as to please Him. But please understand an important principle: God’s laws, contained for us in His Word, are for our good both here and now, as well as hereafter. The Father doesn’t give us the Bible to restrict us, or to make us miserable in life, but that we might have life abundantly,  cf. John 10:10b . What this means is that living obediently to the Word of God will help us to avoid many of the “wrecks” of life.   Prayer is also a “spiritual safety switch.” When you are tempted to do something wrong, what do you suppose would happen if you just pulled the “emergency safety switch” by stopping to pray first? If you sincerely asked the Creator to help you have the strength to do the right thing, or asked for help in knowing what the right thing to do was, do you suppose He would ignore that request? I don’t think so, James 1:2-8 !   Fellowship with Christians is also a “spiritual safety switch.” Think about it: Do you get your “hands” in the wrong places (by doing things you shouldn’t) when you are around other Christians, or when you are in the company of worldly people? Obviously, it is easier to “do right” when you are around and associated with other people who are doing right. But, the inverse is also obviously true, 1Corinthians 15:33 , “Bad company corrupts good morals.”   See? Safety switches aren’t always aggravating and unnecessary!"],"title":["Saftey Switches"],"_resultNumber":190,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/saftey_switches","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":190},{"body":["During the time and in the general area that the New Testament was being given by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to those who wrote it, the most ferocious beast around was probably the lion. Doubtless, many people were attacked, maimed, or killed by them at that time and in those places. Given these things, it is no wonder that the Spirit chose to use the image of the lion to describe the danger, ferocity, and destructive power of Satan- “Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls about like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.” ( 1Peter 5:8 ) But perhaps we ought to think more about this particular analogy….  Satan is indeed aptly represented by the lion with regard to his massive power (against humans at least), his capacity for cruelty, and his destructive capabilities. But consider also the following.   Satan is a “roaring” lion. I remember when we took our oldest son, now 21, to the zoo. He was a little boy of maybe two or three at the time. We were somewhere near, but not at, the lion's den when apparently some other zoo patrons coaxed him to roar. That little boy wasn’t the only one who took off running! That lion’s roar was so loud that it seemed to part your hair- even the ones on your arms. His presence was unmistakable. Everyone knew he was near, and hoped that he was still in his cage! But do you know what? “Roaring” lions are easy to identify, locate, and therefore avoid. “Resist the devil and he will flee from you.” ( James 4:7b )   Satan is a “caged” or “chained’ lion. The first mention of Satan being limited, or bound, is in Matthew 12:28-29 where Jesus spoke of casting devils out of people possessed by them. Satan’s power was being limited. The second reference is in Hebrews 2:14-15 where Satan’s power over man through sin and death is bound by the deliverance and salvation of the cross of Christ. A third reference to the binding of Satan is found in Revelation 20:1-3 . Satan was attempting to destroy the church through the persecution of the Roman government (the beast), and emperor worship (the false prophet). But these efforts failed, and the church, through Christ’s power and assistance, remained. Satan was again “chained” (or limited, or restricted ). As a lion, he still has obvious power to destroy- but his power is limited by the salvation and protection of Jesus Christ. Now, if one is destroyed by a caged, bound, or chained roaring lion, who really is to blame? A chained lion can certainly be resisted,  1Peter 5:9 , “But resist him, firm in your faith…”    Satan is a lion that has to be fed to be a real threat to us. Question: what happens to a caged/chained lion that you don’t feed? His power to destroy is obviously further diminished, if not eliminated altogether, right? What we must realize is that Satan is only able to utilize what we give him in tempting us. Notice a couple of passages on this point. James 1:14 , “But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust. ” The word here translated as “enticed” means “to bait, to catch by bait.” Satan feeds on what we give him- our weaknesses and temptations, to keep his strength up so that he can lure us close enough to destroy us (remember he’s caged/chained ). Consider also Romans 13:14 , “But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts. ” Did you get that? Don’t “make provisions” for your fleshly lusts. Don’t make it easy for Satan to destroy you by continuing to “feed” him with your fleshly/sinful desires. Such is the source of his power. Instead, “put on the Lord Jesus Christ”!   Please realize that for Satan to have the ability to destroy us, we have to help him. We must: ignore his obvious warning “roars”; walk into his cage (or within the length of his chain); and continually feed him with our sinful desires.

But when God answers a prayer unfavorably, the petitioner often surrenders his faith completely. Why, do you suppose?  Is our faith in God actually dependent upon Him doing everything we ask? Such is not supposed to be the foundation of our faith! Romans 10:17 says, “So faith comes from hearing, and by the word of Christ.” The Gospel of Jesus Christ is supposed to be the source of our faith- not whether He fulfills our every request. Did your parents give you everything you wanted when you were a child? Did you doubt their love and provision for you because they said “No” to some of your requests? Would it have been in your best interest for them to grant every immature and short-sighted demand you made? So why should our faith in God falter when He refuses some of our appeals? It shouldn’t- but it often does.  But let’s take this a step further and ask, “Why doesn’t God answer my prayer?” There can be several answers to that question:   God may not be “listening” to you. Notice 1Peter 3:12 , “For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears attend to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”  The Proverbial writer put it a little differently, but to the same point, “He who turns away his ear from listening to the law, even his prayer is an abomination.” ( Proverbs 28:9 ) The point is that we cannot expect God to hear and answer our every request if we have no regard for Him and His law. Some live with complete disregard of God until some tragedy arises, then they want to pray. Don’t get me wrong, we certainly should pray to the Almighty during times of difficulty, but if that is the only time we care enough about God to pray, these Scriptures offer no guarantee of His hearing, let alone answering, our prayer.   You have to ask “in faith.”  When James spoke of the importance of asking God for wisdom, he added this stipulation: “But let him ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts… let not that man expect that he will receive anything from the Lord.” ( James 1:6-7 ). The “faith” of which James writes is in God, and His power and His willingness to provide all that we truly need. We cannot pray, as many have, “God, if there is a God….” To expect an answer to our prayers, we must be completely convinced in mind and heart that God exists, and will judge us eternally, “And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.” ( Hebrews 11:6 ).   You have to ask for “right” things. Praying “in faith” surely must also include the understanding that God will not give us what is against His will, or is not in our best interest. Why would God do for us that which is against His will? It is an act of parental love for God to refuse to grant our requests- however righteous we are, and however sincerely we make them, if they are contrary to His perfect will, or not in our best interest. Surely we realize that our time-limited perspectives and physically-dominated requests are not always in harmony with God’s eternal wisdom and spiritual judgment. Notice 1John 5:14 , “And this is the confidence we have before Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will , He hears us.”    You have to also ask with the “right” motives. Listen carefully to James 4:3 , “You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives , so that you may spend it on your pleasures.” This point seems to go right along with the previous one. We have to ask for “right” things for the “right” reasons. So what are “right” reasons? Read the prayer the Lord taught the disciples in Matthew 6:9-13 , then answer this: “How of many ‘things’ for which the Lord taught the disciples to pray were physical vs. spiritual?” Now think about your prayers. Is the content more physically or spiritually oriented? The point is simple. We ought to be praying for things that will help us carry out God’s will, not asking God for things to help us carry out our will.   Answered prayer is an amazingly powerful boost to our faith. But when God says “No” or “Not now,” there is a reason. Let’s trust His judgment in these matters, OK?"],"title":["“Why Doesn’t God Answer My Prayer?”"],"_resultNumber":193,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/why_doesnt_god_answer_my_prayer","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":193},{"body":["If speaking of present humanity, some of us are just... well, “odd.” From hairdos that look like they were created with a blender (that perhaps had the remains of a fruit smoothie still in it), to poking holes in all sorts of weird body parts, to looking like we fell face-first into a box of fishhooks, some of us these days are just odd. But such is not exactly what Peter meant in 1Peter 2:9 when he wrote, “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people…” Was he implying that Christians are supposed to be “weird,” or “odd”? I’d have to say the answer is both “No” and “Yes.” Let me explain...  The Greek word the King James translators rendered as “peculiar” actually means “a possession; one’s own property.” More recent translations reflect this definition with “a people for God’s own possession”. The peculiarity of Christians is that they belong especially to God. I know what you’re thinking, “But doesn’t everyone belong to God?” In the absolute sense of being His creation, yes, of course they do. However, Peter is talking about Christians as being separate from the world. Everyone belongs to God by right of creation- but we have no choice or activity in that. Christians, on the other hand, choose to belong to God by special commitment and covenant. This makes Christians different in that they belong to God in an additional and special sense. This makes them peculiarly His by their choice and covenant.  But Christians, by their choice of and covenant with God to be His people, are also “different” from others in additional ways.  Christians think differently from the world. Worldly people think selfishly- “It’s my life, I’ll live it any way I please as long as it lasts.” This mindset is described in Titus 1:15 , “… to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and their consciences are defiled.” But Christians tend to think more selflessly- “God paid for my sins with the sacrifice of His dear Son, so I need to live for him.” Thus, God’s people have a different mindset- one that is “…transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.” ( Romans 12:2 )  Christians also feel differently from the world. Worldly people love things that are carnal and temporary- like possessions and physical life, 1John 2:15 , “For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.” Christians, by contrast, love things that are spiritual and eternal- like the Word of God ( 1Peter 1:23; 2:2 ), worshipping God ( John 4:23-24 ), their brethren ( 1Peter 1:22 ), and everlasting life ( Luke 1:77; Hebrews 5:9 ).  And finally, Christians act differently from the world. Because worldly people think and feel carnally, they also live carnally. They live only to please themselves, “and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.” ( Romans 8:8 ) But Christians live differently- Paul expressed it this way in Galatians 5:24  “Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.” Christians strive to please not themselves, but God, “Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those without strength and not just please ourselves…For even Christ did not please Himself…” ( Romans 15;1,3 )  Christians aren’t to be different from everyone else just for the sake of being different. But being “a people for God’s own possession” requires that they think, feel, and live differently through their obedience to His word- “so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God…”  Colossians 1:10 . Being “different” like this is the best way to live now, and the only way to live eternally."],"title":["Peculiar People"],"_resultNumber":194,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/peculiar_people","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":194},{"body":["As the New Year begins, self-evaluation and enthusiasm for self-improvement is typically at an annual high. There is usually a whole host of things about ourselves we determine to improve. On this list are often at least a couple of items pertaining to our level of interest and activity. In other words, there’s something (or several) at which we resolve to do a better job of cultivating interest and improving activity. So, we vow to either get up earlier or get off the couch more often to accomplish this resolved commitment. Such things got me to thinking about the “sluggard” of Proverbs , and the excuses he put forth for his lack of interest and activity.   “Sluggard” is not a common word in our current vernacular, but it is often found in the book of Proverbs . However, it is not a hard word to define- it simply means plain old “ lazy .” There are some thirteen references to “the sluggard” in this book of wisdom, depending of course on the translation. Most of them refer to his lack of initiative and industry in making a living for himself and his family, and warnings of the incumbent results of such. But let’s see if we can use the words of one of the primary texts dealing with the subject relative to more spiritual matters. It seems to me that most of us tend to get more “lazy” with regard to our spiritual obligations than perhaps we do with our physical responsibilities. To that end, let’s take another look at Proverbs 26:13-16 .  There are four key attributes of a sluggard given in the text.  1) The sluggard  imagines obstacles   ,  v.13 . He says, “There is a lion in the road! A lion is in the open square!” A real lion might be an obstacle, cf. 1Peter 5:8 , but not to a real man of God, cf. Daniel 6:16-24 ! But real obstacles are not so much a problem for the spiritual sluggard as the imagined ones. When we find ourselves inventing reasons not to do what we know we ought to and can do, we’ve surely become a spiritual sluggard!  2) The sluggard  goes nowhere   ,  v.14 . “Like the door turns on its hinges, so does the sluggard on his bed.” Think about the metaphor employed. A door may be opened and shut a hundred times a day, but never goes anywhere! Of course, the application made of the image is that of a sluggard turning in his bed , but never getting out of it. However, think further. Spiritual sluggards may give the appearance of a lot of activity, but in reality, they never make any real progress. And as a result, they remain spiritual infants (who never get up, grow, mature, learn to walk, run, and work for the Lord), 1Corinthians 3:1-3  à  9:24-27 .  3) The sluggard  starves because he ‘wearies’ of feeding himself,   v.15 . He “buries his hand in the dish; he is weary of bringing it to his mouth again.” Here is one who evidently, and likely through no effort on his part, has ample nutrition before him, but is too lazy to even feed himself! I fear this hits too close to home for many spiritual sluggards in regard to feeding themselves from the milk and meat of the Word of God. They are willing to eat if the preacher or bible class teacher will “spoon-feed” them, but rarely feed themselves by studying on their own, and may even complain and not eat if what they are “spoon-fed” is too hot, cold, much, little , or etc. etc. etc. Thus, they starve to spiritual death because they are too lazy to even feed themselves, despite the ample availability of nutrition, cf. Hebrew 5:11 – 6:8 .  4) The sluggard  thinks he knows it all,   v.16 , he “is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who can give a discreet answer.” Though he imagines all possible obstacles to progress, goes nowhere himself because he can never seem to get up and get going, and starves himself because he is too lazy to avail himself of available nutrition, he still knows more about everything than everyone!  James implies that we should be wary of those who tell us how smart they are, cf. 1:19,26; 2:3ff,12,14,16,18; 3:1-12 , rather than simply demonstrating true wisdom through their actions, cf.1:27; 2:15-17,20-26; 3:13 .  As we begin a new year, let’s make sure to include (and follow through on) the spiritual resolution to abandon spiritual laziness and truly “abound in the work of the Lord,”  1Corinthians 15:58 !"],"title":["Spiritual Sluggards"],"_resultNumber":195,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/spiritual_sluggards","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":195},{"body":["Isn’t it funny how the same word can mean so very different things to different people based on who and what they are? For instance, to a young female, the word “engaged” refers to  the promise of forthcoming marriage. To someone who likes to talk, “engaged” refers to someone who is engrossed in a conversation. For me, and those who think in more mechanical terms, the word “engaged” usually first means that one gear is meshed with another, or a another group of gears, to produce a specific movement or activity. All of these various comprehensions of the word are correct, depending of course on how the word is being used at the time. I’m told that this is what makes English one of the most difficult languages to learn– that the same word can have such vastly different meanings and applications.    So what does any of this have to do with spiritual matters?    “Engaged,” in all three meanings previously suggested, has spiritual applications.      In the matrimonial sense, we, as Christians, are “betrothed to one husband” who is Jesus Christ ( 2Cor.11:2 ) . While betrothal is not exactly the same as our “engagement” process today, the two are very similar. The difference between them is that betrothal was a binding agreement of marriage which lacked only consummation. If betrothed, you were, for all intents and purposes, married. In fact, to not consummate a marriage after the betrothal required a divorce. The Greek term, harmodzo (betrothed), meant to join or fit together , as a carpenter would join beams and planks to make a house, or as a husband and wife would come together to make a family. In this sense, we are to be joined together with our spiritual husband , Jesus Christ, John 3:39; Eph.5:23ff; Rev.21:9 . So, are you being faithful to the “engagement” promises of marriage you made to your spiritual husband, Jesus?       The second application of “engage” had to do with being engrossed in conversation with another. When we speak of someone being “engaged in conversation,” it usually implies that these two parties are exclusively conversing with each other. They may be in a room crowded with people, but are so intent on the conversation with one another that they are oblivious to the other people in the room. There is a spiritual aspect in this definition also. The word used in Acts 24:26 to depict Felix’s (the Roman Governor of Judea) conversing with Paul is the Greek word homileo , which is defined as “to be in company with; to associate with; to stay with; to converse with” ( Enhanced Strong’s Lexicon ). Think about being thus “engaged” with God in these ways. Are you “in company with” God? Amos wrote that two cannot walk together unless there is agreement between them. Do you “associate with” and “stay with” God? Both John and the Psalmist would call this “abiding” with God. Do you regularly “engage” in conversing with God by reading His Word and talking to Him through prayer? Are you “engaged” in conversing with God?       Finally, “engaged” had the mechanical application of a gear being meshed together with another gear, or another group of gears, to produce a specific movement or activity. How many times have you heard of (or been) a Christian who “never really meshed in a particular congregation”? What is usually meant is that this person never really fit in or became part of the work of that local group. There may be many reasons which account for this problem. But the effect is always the same– this person doesn’t accomplish much for the Lord, or that congregation! And, the congregation suffers the loss of whatever the unmeshed member had to offer. For a gear or a church member to be involved in “producing a specific movement or activity” (which means “work” in the mechanical or membership sense) it has to be “engaged in” and “meshed with” the other constituent parts. One gear alone never accomplishes anything! It has to become “engaged” with other gears to produce the desired effect. In church membership terms, this means that we have to “engage” ourselves by becoming involved with the work and worship of the congregation. Again, here’s the question: Are you “engaged” in this sense? Are you active participants in the work and worship of the congregation, or are you, as one gear alone, just sitting idly by and accomplishing nothing.     English may be a difficult language because of the various applications one word may have. But it sure provides rich soil for us preachers to expound upon biblical principles! Thanks for following along, and do please consider whether or not you are truly “engaged”!"],"title":["“Engaged”"],"_resultNumber":196,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/engaged","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":196},{"body":["The Apostle Paul feared the church in Corinth would be “led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ.” He feared that, “as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness” ( 2Corinthians 11:3 ), their minds would also be corrupted into apostasy. He had previously said of and to them, “but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.” ( 1Corinthians 6:11 ) But now he is concerned that they might be “led astray” from simple and pure devotion to Christ.  Two things become readily apparent from these things: 1) the threat of apostasy is very real for the child of God; Satan does not stop working on us when we become devoted to Christ; the comforting doctrine of “once saved- always saved” doesn’t seem to be giving much comfort to Paul concerning his beloved brethren in Corinth; and 2) “simplicity and purity” should characterize our devotion to God. It is this last one that I would like us to think about further just now.  Our “devotion to Christ” is supposed to be, if Satan hasn’t led our minds astray from it, characterized by both “simplicity” and “purity.” With regard to the simplicity of it, let’s take the Lord’s Supper for example. On the night in Jesus was betrayed, He instituted a simple, sweet memorial which His followers were to utilize to commemorate His sacrifice by the partaking of unleavened bread and fruit of the vine. The bread was to be unleavened since “leaven” (yeast) is often symbolic of sin in the biblical text ( cf. 1Cor.5:6-8 ). This bread symbolizes the “body” of Jesus, 1Cor.11:23-24 which was obviously free from sin, 1Pet.2:22 . And the fruit of the vine likewise symbolizes His “blood of the covenant…shed on behalf of many for forgiveness of sins.” ( Matt.26:28 ) He intended for His disciples to utilize this simple memorial, and the partaking of these emblems, on the first day of each week ( Acts 20:7 ) to commemorate His sacrifice for our sins. We don’t have to rise with the sun to do so, nor do we have to dim the lights or play special music or add anything else to make this simple memorial more special. The giving of thanks for the emblems, what they represent, and entreating the Father’s blessing upon them is sufficient if we will partake “in remembrance of Me” as He commanded in 1Cor.11:25 . It’s just that simple and pure. We don’t have to “dress it up” or allow ourselves to be “led astray” by Satan into defiling its purity with complications.  But the simplicity facet is not only for our partaking of the Lord’s Supper. It should also apply to all aspects of our devotion- whether public or private. We shouldn’t feel the need to “dress up” or complicate any aspect of our worship, beliefs, or practices beyond what the Scriptures require. God tells us what He wants, and we should and must content ourselves with what He has said in all areas of faith and practice. Just read, understand, and live what the Gospel (the New Testament) teaches- no more, and certainly no less. Now isn’t that a “simple” plan?  The other characteristic of our devotion to Christ that Paul emphasizes is that of purity. Purity refers to that which is undiluted or uncontaminated. So the question soon becomes, “Undiluted or uncontaminated with what?” Jesus addressed this point in a couple of passages from Matthew : “This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far away from Me. But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men.” ( 15:8-9 ) “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord’ will enter the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of My Father, who is in heaven.” ( 7:21 )The point should be clear: “pure” devotion is that which is “undiluted” and “uncontaminated” with the thoughts, desires, and teachings of men instead of coming “purely” from the Word of God. Again, just read, understand, and live what the Gospel teaches- no more, and certainly no less. Not only is it a simple and pure plan, it is God’s plan for saving us."],"title":["A Simple Plan"],"_resultNumber":197,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/a_simple_plan","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":197},{"body":["Repentance is a requirement of salvation, Luke 13:3,5 . Some folks say that it is the most difficult of all the obligations God has specified. They may be right. But as with most things God requires of us, repentance becomes more problematic when we: 1) don’t really understand exactly what it is; and/or, 2) go about it wrongly. Hopefully, what follows will help in both regards.  Getting an accurate definition of repentance is vital. Repentance is not simply changing your mind- as such does not address the activity. Likewise, repentance is not just changing your activity- for such does not necessarily address the mind. From these things, it would seem that repentance is a “change of mind that leads to a change of activity/action.” While this is a pretty good basic definition, perhaps one additional element would help. Think about repentance as “a change of mind that leads to a change of activity/action and results in a change of allegiance” ( see Romans 6:16-18 ). With hopefully a better understanding of what repentance is, let’s consider a few examples of how we typically fail to do it right, and thus make it more difficult.  1) We propose  timed repentance.  We tell ourselves, others, and even God that we will “straighten up” at some future date on the calendar, or after some event occurs in our lives. This is the notion behind spiritual resolutions tied to January 1 st . The other form this one takes is that “I’ll straighten out my life after ____ (I: get out of college; or get married; or have children; or get settled in my career; or become successful; or etc.).” This one also often incorporates the “wild oats” logic- that is, “Have fun now, repent or straighten up later.” This surely can’t be true repentance because although it acknowledges the propriety of doing God’s will in the mind, it rebelliously delays obedience to God’s will until later and substitutes instead “my” will now. Our activity hasn’t really changed at all.  2) We attempt  conditional repentance   . We try to “strike a deal” with God- such as, “Lord, if you will do this/that for me, then I will quit _____.” God is not Monty Hall (for you younger folks, he was the famous host of the long-running TV game show, “Let’s Make a Deal”)! I suppose we think that in this arrangement, to which God never agreed, by the way, if God doesn’t come through with “His end of the deal,” then we are freed from our obligation to repent. This is not repentance because the mind has not really changed- we’re just offering to restrict our activities on a conditional basis contingent upon God fulfilling our wishes.  3) We practice  reluctant repentance.  In this scenario, we understand the need for repentance in our minds, at least for eternal self-preservation, if nothing else, and we curtail our activities to bring them more into compliance to God’s will, but we’re not really happy about it. It usually goes something like, “I’d really like to ____ (fill in worldly activity of choice), but I can’t because I’m a Christian (sigh).” In this case, we may indeed be doing the “right” things, and even refusing to participate in the “wrong” ones, but our heart is certainly not in it! Our mind understands, and our activities are in compliance, but our allegiance has not really changed.  Obviously, none of these situations constitutes the true and necessary repentance that God requires. True biblical repentance, on the other hand:  a) Is motivated by sorrow for sin . It is not being sorry “I got caught,” but genuine distress for having disappointed God, 2Corinthians 7:9 . Our minds are changed because we understand that we have failed to carry out “the will of God.”   b) Is without regret. There is no reluctance or regret in changing our activities to come into compliance with God’s word because our true desire is to please Him rather than ourselves, 2Corinthians 7:10 . Our activities are thus changed, not because we “have to,” but because we “want to” be pleasing and useful to God. Now our allegiance has necessarily changed also, 2Corinthians 7:11-12 .  So, have you truly repented so that your mind, activity, and allegiance have changed? Or, are you just going through the motions of putting on some outward show of feigned contrition, cf. Matthew 3:8 ?"],"title":["Real Repentance"],"_resultNumber":198,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/real_repentance","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":198},{"body":["Several years ago, when I was “hairless” due to chemotherapy, I was feeling pretty well one day so Donna and I decided to get out of the house and go somewhere. I was in the shower when she came happily bee-bopping into the bathroom to “fix” her hair. Without really thinking it through, she accusingly asked, “Did you use up all my hair spray?” I slowly pulled back the shower door, stuck my bald head out and said, “No, and furthermore I didn’t wear out your hairbrush or use up all your shampoo either!” Realizing what she had said, she quickly apologized, and we both had a huge laugh. Reflecting on this story started me thinking…  Do realize how many hair-care products there are on the market? Shampoos are advertised with everything from fruit to acai berry antioxidants in them. There are seemingly an endless array of conditioners, de-tanglers, anti-frizz, straighteners, curlers, color-enhancers, color-changers, and even hair grower/restorer products available. And besides these, all sorts of clippers, trimmers, irons, crimpers, and styling tools are constantly being advertised. Evidently, a lot of us pay a tremendous amount of attention to, and money on, our hair!  The Bible is not devoid of discussion on the topic of hair either. Those taking the Nazirite vow first shaved their heads, burned the hair on the sacrificial fire at the tabernacle, and then didn’t cut their hair again until the completion of the vow, cf. Numbers 6:2-21 . Absalom, King David’s rebellious son, though certainly not under the Nazirite vow, was dramatically jerked from the mule he was riding when his long and thick hair became entangled in tree branch under which he rode while being pursued, 2Samuel14:25-26; 18:9-14 (he was later killed by Joab while still suspended there). The boys who teased God’s prophet Elisha about his “baldhead” were certainly taught a lesson. Elisha “cursed them in the name of the Lord” and then two female bears came out of the woods and “tore up forty-two” of them! And who can forget Samson, whose miraculous strength was so closely tied to his hair- because of his Nazirite vow, that when it was finally cut he became powerless to fend off the Philistines, Judges 13:2-5; 16:1-21 ?  The New Testament also has more than a few references to the hair of the head. 1Corinthians 11:1-16 indicates that the hair can bring either glory or dishonor depending on how it is kept and worn. 1Timothy 2:9-10 and 1Peter 3:3-4 also warn against elaborate or showy hairstyles, as they are contrary to the godly spirit of modesty and discretion. One of the most touching specific mentions of hair surely must be the penitent woman of Luke 7:36ff . Mary, the sister of Lazarus ( John 11:2 ), wet Jesus’ feet with her tears and wiped them clean with her hair! Then too, of course, is Jesus’ statement in Matthew 5:36 , “Nor shall you make an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.” Obviously, Jesus never met Miss Clairol!  But to me, the most striking “picture” given in the New Testament of human hair has to do with God’s numbering of them. In Luke 12:1-7 , Jesus is speaking specifically to His twelve disciples about their role in preaching the gospel, and the dangers they would face in doing so. In this context He tells them not to “be afraid of those who can kill the body, and after they have no more that they can do,”  v.4 . He then warns them to fear instead, “the One who after He has killed has the authority to cast into hell,”  v.5 . Fear can be a great motivator! But He then bolsters their faith and confidence with these words, “Are not five sparrows sold for two cents? And yet not one of them is forgotten before God,  v.6 . God’s omniscient (all-knowing) powers are incredible! They are, however, not limited to sparrows for the next verse adds, “Indeed the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear; you are of more value than many sparrows,”  v.7 . As incredible as the omniscience of God is, such is not really the point here. Instead, Jesus is telling His disciples that God’s intimate knowledge of each of them should give them confidence in Him to save their souls even if men should kill them for their preaching of the gospel. God not only knows and cares for His own, but He will ultimately bring them to His eternal home if they fear, love, and obey Him!  Though these words were spoken to the Twelve, God knows about your “hair” too- and will likewise do the same for you…if you also fear, love, and obey Him."],"title":["Hair"],"_resultNumber":199,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/hair","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":199},{"body":["We humans have three major physical parts: the “thinking” part (intellect); the “feeling” part (emotion); and the “doing” part (body). [I’m excepting the spiritual part, the soul, for the purposes of this particular article.] We usually refer to them as the mind, the heart, and the body. The New Testament recognizes these distinctions, but sometimes also utilizes the “heart” as the seat of the intellect, Mark 2:8  “And immediately Jesus, perceiving in His spirit that they were reasoningthat way within themselves, said to them, ‘Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts?’”  Jesus here said they “reasoned” in their “hearts”- rather than in/with their “minds.” However, in other places the emotional and intellectual seats are kept distinct from one another, Phil.2:7 , “And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, shall guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.” By listing the heart and the mind separately the distinction between them can be discerned. Now that we have that out of the way, the main point is still that we are made of three distinct parts: the mind , the heart , and the body - so far so good.  The trouble comes in when we use the wrong part for the wrong thing.  For instance, some people (usually men) are accused of “thinking” with their bodies. That is, their physical desires take over their “thinking.” This is not good. Our minds are supposed to do our thinking- not our bodies, or any particular part of them. When the physical part of who we are dominates our thoughts and actions rather than intellect, problems are sure to result. Our bodies are supposed to influence our thoughts and actions, not take them over. Our stomach growls so the mind thinks, “It’s time to eat.” This is normal, natural, and necessary. But if the stomach takes over the thought processes we become gluttonously addicted to food.  Likewise, if our emotions dominate our thinking we are also sure to make mistakes. For instance, how many of us have trusted someone with our hearts that our heads said not to trust? And how did that work out for you? Me too! The problem was we were thinking with the wrong part. We let our feelings and emotions overrule our intellect. But at the same time, it must be noted that if our “thinking” is not influenced by our emotions, we become cold, calculating, and tyrannical. Just like our mind has to listen to our body while not being dominated by it, we have to listen to our heart without being overcome by emotion in our thinking. Otherwise, we might become an “emotional basket case.”  What’s the point? There are a couple of points to be discerned from these things. First, we need to use the appropriate part to do our thinking. We can’t think properly with our bodies or our hearts- we have to use our heads. Second, God wants “all” of who we are to understand, love, and obey Him. We can’t use just our heads, for then devotion to Him will only become merely academic (the problem in Athens, Acts 17:19-23 ). We can’t just use our hearts, for then our feelings will likely lead us away from rather toward God (the problem of Paul’s Hebrew countrymen highlighted in Rom.10:2-3 ). And we can’t just use our bodies, for then we wind up devoted to ourselves rather than to God (which makes us God’s enemy as in Phil.3:18-19 ).  Instead we must believe with our minds based on evidence that God is, Heb.11:6a . And we must trust with our hearts that God will reward those who obey Him with their bodies, Heb.11:6b . Folks, that is exactly how Heb.11:6 defines “faith”- belief in the mind, trust in the heart, and obedience with the body. That kind of faith surely saves. Are you using your mind, heart, and body in faith to the salvation of your soul (that spiritual part we didn’t really discuss, but that we all know exists)? We have to use the right part for the right thing to get to where God wants us to be you know!"],"title":["Thinking with the Right Part"],"_resultNumber":200,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/thinking_with_the_right_part","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":200},{"body":["Trust is an essential element of faith, along with knowledge and obedience ( Hebrews 11:6,1 ). But do even those of us who claim to have faith really trust God?   Do we really trust God regarding the Past?   Hebrews 11:3 tells us about the creation of the world, “By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible.” Does your faith allow you to trust God in this regard? Do you really “understand” what is being said here? What we see and know as the Universe didn’t just happen as a result of an explosion. The “worlds” that we see were created out of things that we cannot see. They were not assembled from known elements, but by the eternal power of Divine speech. Romans 1:20 reinforces the same point, “For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made…” This means that we ought to discern the divine power and eternal nature of God by just looking at the created world(s) around us. Now, do you really trust God regarding the past, or have years of evolutionary theory led you to trust “science” more than God?   Do we really trust God regarding the Present?  It would seem easier to trust God about the present because we live in the present- we ostensibly don’t need “faith” to see the present. But I would suggest the here and now requires a greater faith than either the past or the future. Think about it this way: we are to “live by faith” ( Hebrews 10:38 ; et al ). Living by faith is actually a greater test than having faith regarding the past, or the future. We don’t (or at least shouldn’t) live in the past, cf. Philippians 3:13-14 ; or the future, James 4:13-16 . But we must live, and live by faith, in the present. James 4:17 , “Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do, and does not do it, to him it is sin.” Do we trust God regarding how we are supposed to live? If we trust God and His Word regarding the past, do we trust Him and the Bible enough to live as He dictates in the present? I know human weakness comes into play here- believe me, I know that from personal experience. Knowing what God expects and not doing it because of weakness is one thing; but deliberately deciding to forgo God’s Word for what we want is rebellion. If we’re prone to think or say, “I know the Bible says this, but I think/feel….” then we really don’t trust God regarding the present, do we? In such cases, we trust our own thoughts and emotions more than we do God’s. We also manifest a lack of trust in God regarding the present when we consult every kind of “expert” on the difficult decisions of life but refuse to consult God’s word, let alone follow it.   Do we really trust God regarding the Future?  Almost everyone has heard the sentiment expressed by preachers and songwriters that we should “live every day as if it were your last,” or to “live like you were dying.” The idea seems to be that we should live ready to die. These are great sentiments. But until we’re really OK with dying  today  , those are just sentiments! If we really trust God with our futures, these are not just sentiments, they are our reality. Why are so many of us afraid to die? I understand the natural fear of the unknown- after all, we’ve never died before. And I understand folks being afraid of death if they know they are unprepared to meet their Maker. But why is it that professed believers fear death, and cling to every last breath like their “life” depends on it? ( see John 3:36; 14:1-4 ) Don’t we trust God? He said, “Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord….that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow with them” ( Revelation 14:13 ), but we still fear death like there is no tomorrow! Why, if we trust God regarding our future?  The bottom line is this: If we trust God regarding His wisdom and power which was manifested in the past through the creation of the world(s), then we should trust Him in the present by living lives of faithful obedience. Then, we can trust Him regarding our future when this life is finished, whenever that may be. Now, isn’t that simple? The question is: Do you really trust God regarding the past, the present, and the future? We really can’t have one without the other two."],"title":["Trusting God Regarding the Past, Present, and Future"],"_resultNumber":201,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/trusting_god_regarding_the_past_present_and_future","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":201},{"body":["Is the world turning “upside down”? It sure seems like it to me!    When Paul and Silas came to ancient Thessalonica, according to their custom, they went to the synagogue of the Jews and “for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures, explaining and giving evidence” concerning Jesus Christ as the basis of Christianity, cf. Acts 17:2-3. The preaching of Jesus produced its intended effect and many were converted from Judaism to Christianity. This sparked opposition from non-believing Jews, who in turn, became jealous and took along “some wicked men from the market place, formed a mob and set the city in an uproar.…” In their jealous rage, they sought the lives of Paul and Silas. But the mob couldn’t find the preachers, so they settled instead for a man named Jason, and drug him and some other believers before the Thessalonian city officials. Acts 17:6 records the event this way, “…..they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city authorities, shouting, “These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also….” (English Standard Version). Despite themselves having “set the city in an uproar” (v.5), this mob accused the preachers of the gospel of Christ and those converted by it of having “turned the world upside down”! How is it so often true that the guilty blame the innocent of their own or similar crimes?    Could any successfully now argue that current news stories indicate anything other than a world turning upside down- especially in economics and finance? The stock markets of the world fluctuate wildly. Businesses are collapsing. Our government is pumping billions of tax dollars into the mortgage banking industry, and is contemplating the same for the “Big Three” auto makers in (most would say “misguided”) efforts to stabilize the economy. Seafaring pirates have captured an oil tanker and are holding the ship, its crew, and its $100 million cargo hostage. Terrorist organizations and their leaders issue threats to the world and criticize elections here in the U.S. (Ayman al-Zawahiri, the number two man in Al Qaeda). A trial began this week of a mother accused of using the internet social site MySpace to taunt and ridicule a former friend of her daughter’s to the point that the girl committed suicide. Is the world turning “upside down”? It sure seems like it to me!    So, what’s to be done? Many say that “assigning blame” for the current host of economic and moral calamities is not the answer.  I strongly disagree.  What if your doctor decided that “assigning blame” wasn’t important to either your diagnosis or treatment when you’re sick? How successful would he or she be treating an illness which he could not identify, or for which he could not assign a cause? Even if some prescribed general antibiotic was successful, nothing would prevent a reoccurrence of the same problem (perhaps with even more devastating effects!) since the source of the problem wasn’t identified and subsequently treated or eliminated.    The obvious question for all of this then becomes:  “What, or who, is to blame as the source of the current upside down world calamities we’re experiencing?”  And “no” it isn’t the Democrats or the Republicans of government (at least in the “bigger picture” view). The answer to this important question is  Charles Darwin  a  nd those who believe in, and propagate, his false theories of Evolution at every level!  How so? Read on.    It readily admitted that total responsibility cannot be laid completely on Mr. Darwin. He formulated a theory that many have expounded upon. Then too, it is the application of his theory which has produced much of this current calamity. Here’s how.    Mr. Darwin theorized on the formation of life- that it ultimately came from chance and circumstance rather than a benevolent and all-powerful Creator.  The effect of the acceptance of his theory was atheism.  In support of this logic, hear the words of noted evolutionist Aldous Huxley, “I had motives for not wanting the world to have meaning….The liberation we desired was simultaneously liberation  from a certain political and economic system and liberation from a certain system of morality. We objected to morality because it interfered with our sexual freedom”  (Ends and Means; 1946; emphasis added, PCS). Did you get that? He, and doubtlessly others, accepted evolution as the origin of the species to rid himself of the restrictions of morality. From where did these restrictions of morality come? God, of course! If God is eliminated as the Creative Power of the Universe, then God is removed from man’s morality as well. If Jehovah is not the Originator of man, neither is He the originator of man’s morality.  Man, as the product of evolution instead of God, is thus freed from any restraints he refuses to place upon himself!    One more quote on this point from Huxley’s son, Sir Julian Huxley, “Darwinism removed the whole idea of God as the creator…Darwin pointed out that no supernatural designer was needed; since natural selection could account for any known form of life, there was no room for a supernatural agency”. With “the whole idea of God” removed, man was, through evolutionary thought and explanations, his own “god” with no one other than himself to whom any accounting should ever have to be done. (see 2Cor.5:10)    I hear some logically saying, “OK, so what does this have to do with our world being turned upside down right now?” In one word,  GREED!  “Greed” with regard to corporate raiders who buy, sell, and/or bankrupt companies for personal profit. “Greed” with regard to players on the stock market looking to capitalize on a “big something return for a little of nothing investment.” Such isn’t just dealers of junk bonds, it’s people rolling the stock market dice with their retirement plans hoping to quit work early and filthy rich. It’s politicians looking to parlay a political seat into wealth and power for life by promising to fulfill the greedy desires of those who elect them- and that’s you and me! Stop and think about what all you expect “the government” to pay for: is it more or less than the New Testament would define as government’s divinely appointed role? (cf. Rom.13:1-7 and 1Pet.2:13-17) This financial world of ours has been turned upside down by one thing, GREED. People are now willing to do anything to anyone to fulfill their own selfish desires. “For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith, and pierced themselves with many a pang.” (1Tim.6:10).      When Darwin and his subordinates convinced most of the world that there was “no room for a supernatural agency” in the origin of man, they convinced the world there was no room for God in the life of man- and morality was left to be defined through natural selection and the survival of the fittest….or the greediest!

So, participation on various judging and Future Farmers of America competition teams was pretty much compulsory for me. Some of them I enjoyed, and others- well, let’s just say I participated with better than mediocre but less than enthusiastic effort. But I enjoyed being on the Forestry Team. I liked trekking through the woods and learning to identify various trees of East Texas. However, being on the Forestry Team also meant learning to run a compass course- and it intimidated (OK, “scared”) me a little. You were given a compass and a set of directions which consisted of moving through the woods- briars, brambles, creeks and all, on a heading for a distance specified in hundreds of feet, then taking a subsequent compass heading for so many feet in a different direction, and so on until you arrived a pre-determined destination. Thus, you were graded on accuracy. I had been in the woods all my life, and wasn’t at all afraid of getting lost, but those compass courses consisted of several different headings for various distances, so any error made was multiplied and exaggerated by subsequent moves. Being only a degree or two off on your initial heading meant that you could be a really long way off by the end of the course!  There were two key elements to the Forestry compass course: 1) the heading- as determined by degrees on the compass; and, 2) being able to accurately walk a specified distance (no tape measures or other devices were allowed for this part). Reading a compass was fairly straightforward, but being able to accurately step off a specified distance took practice. The way we learned to do this was pretty simple, but tedious. Dad got us out in the open field behind the Ag shop and measured and clearly marked two lines one hundred feet apart. Then, using a normal gate, we walked that distance dozens of times- counting our steps each time. The rule was also simple: you could quit walking when you could consistently traverse the distance in the same number of steps each time. It’s been some thirty-two or three years ago, but the best I can remember, one hundred feet was thirty-four steps for me then. There was, however, still one problem- none of the compass courses required you to step distances of exactly one hundred feet! You’d be required to go sixty-seven feet on a heading of fifty-four degrees, then one hundred and thirty-four feet on a heading of two hundred and thirty-one degrees, and then etc. etc. etc. So, to be able to accurately step the correct distances, you had to use mathematics- specifically, ratio and proportion problems. Since you (presumably) knew how many steps it took you to go one hundred feet, using a ratio and proportion formula, you could fairly accurately estimate how many steps it would take you to cover any other given distance.  What has all of this to do with spiritual matters? There are a couple of comparative points to be made regarding the “spiritual course” of life:  1) Small errors in direction or distance are dramatically compounded in our spiritual course also. If we go “off course,” even in some way that we might consider “small,” and then proceed for a long while, or make several other subsequent “course adjustments” that were founded on the first deviation, we can wind up “missing the mark” of what God says by a really long way. Someone might object, “It really doesn’t matter what you believe/practice as long as you’re honest and sincere in it.” If such is true (and it patently is not, cf. Matthew 7:21 !), then you might as well throw your Bible away. In compass and spiritual courses, errors have a way of compounding themselves, so do your best to stay on the course God has given each step of the way!  2) Being able to work “ratio and proportion” problems can keep you on the right spiritual course. Ratio and proportion (multiplying the known number of paces per 100 ft. by distance specified, then dividing by 100 to arrive at the number of paces per the distance specified) is a way of fairly accurate estimation. In spiritual course running, you also have to begin with the “known” and “specified” to be able to arrive at the “unknown” and “unspecified.” This means “running your course” based on what has been “specified” by God in His word (and therefore can be “known” ( see 2Peter 1:3 and 2Timothy 3:16-17 ) to arrive at the “unknown” place of heaven, 2Corinthians 4:17-18 and 5:6-8 . You can’t go off in any direction for any distance you want, and expect to arrive at the desired destination.

Salvation results from the combination of God’s grace and man’s faith- “For by grace you have been saved through faith,”  Ephesians 2:8 . God’s wondrous grace meets man’s faith to allow the guilt of sin to be removed so that man can be in fellowship with divinity. We do not have the right to legislate for God by attempting to apply His grace (and salvation by it) where He hasn’t promised to do so in His Word- that’s “whittling on His end of the stick” as the old timers would say. Instead, we must trust in His word to show us where He will, and won’t, apply grace to produce salvation. Thus, we shouldn’t attempt to apply God’s grace where He hasn’t specified, nor refuse to apply it where He has said that He will do so. It’s just not within our prerogative to do so.  However, faith is on our “end of the stick,” so to speak. To change the illustration, “grace” is on God’s side of the ledger, and “faith” is on man’s side. But since it is, after all, God’s ledger, salvation only occurs when God’s grace and man’s faith are properly combined. As God gets to determine the parameters of His grace, He also gets to define how faith is produced and when it is sufficient for the application of grace to result in salvation. This may sound somewhat strange if we presume that any and all “faith” is sufficient for the application of grace by God. However, this just isn’t how God designed and defined faith. As always, let’s look to His word for proper understanding and application.  “Faith” is often presumed to be a gift of God- that He gives us faith. In a sense such is true, but be careful. True biblical faith is defined by God as coming from “hearing the word of Christ,”  Romans 10:17 . We “hear” Christ when we read His words and the testimony of inspired men who penned the New Testament, “If any one thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I (Paul) write are the Lord’s commandment,”  1Corinthians 14:37 . But go back to the context of Romans 10 and realize that saving faith: is dependent on the word,  v.8 ; necessarily precedes confession and produces righteousness,  v.9-10 ; is inseparably tied to Scripture,  v.11 ; is the basis for all men to call on the Lord, vv.12-13 ; is predicated on hearing the preached (or proclaimed ) word, vv.14-15 ; and is only achieved when the word is heeded (obeyed), v.16 . Friends, this is how God defines “faith” that saves! Thiskind of faith meets the conditions God has specified for man that divine grace can then be applied to produce salvation. Anything less fails to meet God’s standards and criterion. The demons believe, or have faith that Jesus is God’s Son ( cf. James 2:19 ; Matthew 8:29 ), but are obviously not willing to allow His word to define their character and conduct in order to be saved.  What we’re hopefully seeing here is that faith is indeed given by God, but is provided through His provision of the source, or seed, of it- His word, 1Peter 1:22-23 ; Luke 8:11 . God doesn’t give us full-grown saving faith, He gives us the seed that we must accept into the fertile soil of a honest and good heart, and nurture and feed until it grows into an obedient faith that is willing to accept and do what He says is “right” that His grace might then be applied, John 3:36 ; Titus 2:11-15 .  Now, here is the promised practical portion. As saving faith is necessarily tied to hearing and obeying the word of God (as we saw from Romans 10 ), so too any “faith” we have that a practice is right or wrong must also be tied to the word of God. We can’t have “faith” that God will accept a practice, activity, or lifestyle unless His word says so. We cannot rely on our own emotions or desires in these matters regardless of whom or what practice is involved. Any such determinations must be based in a “thus sayeth the Lord” if they are to be “of faith.” We simply do not have the right to legislate for God, or the application of His grace, in these ways. So, we can’t decide to “accept” or condone practices He has condemned and still claim to be operating “by faith.” Our nation is being led to “call evil good, and good evil” ( Isaiah 5:20 ) because our people have forgotten these principles, or are being taught differently from our pulpits. If we are to be right with God, we must first be right with His word. Anything less is not, and cannot be, “of faith.”"],"title":["The Basis of Faith"],"_resultNumber":205,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/the_basis_of_faith","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":205},{"body":["Most people don’t want to be considered “unreasonable.” In fact, some will even compromise or abandon the principles upon which they base their reason just because someone else accuses them of being unreasonable. Do we really understand what it means to be “reasonable” in the first place?  Generally, being “reasonable” means to think, and therefore act, in a rational way. One who has used his intellect to come to a logical conclusion, and then acts accordingly, is usually thought to be “reasonable.” This means the inverse is also true: one who fails to use rational thought processes, and then acts accordingly, is being “unreasonable”- and usually suffers for it!  There are at least a couple of important aspects of these things that we need to consider. “Reasonable” actions come from reason- not impulse. When we react impulsively to a situation without taking the time to “think it through,” we typically wind up acting unreasonably. We are then allowing the quicker but shallower aspects of our desires to cut off opportunity for slower but deeper deliberate thought by acting immediately. Sometimes, we even admit as much by saying, “I’m going to go ahead and do this now before I have time to think about it.” But conversely, God wants us to take the time to allow our intellect to override our impulsive desires before we act or react, for such is the “reasonable” course. For instance, the Lord’s brother wrote that we should be “quick to hear” but “slow to speak and slow to anger,”  James 1:1 . If we stop long enough to really listen and think, we can keep our emotions in check, and perhaps keep our feet out of our mouths also!  Now that we have the principle down, let’s make a few applications of using rational thoughts to produce reasonable decisions and actions (these are largely unrelated otherwise).  Is it reasonable to conclude that the intellect, order, and intricacy of the world just happened accidently by chance, or is that just what we want to believe? The simple principle of Cause and Effect is highlighted in Hebrews 3:4 this way, “For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.” No one “reasonably” looks at a house and concludes that it is the result of a mindless accident of chance- that some existent materials exploded and a house resulted. And yet, many seem to desire to believe that such is the origin of our world and life on it. Surely it is more “reasonable” to believe that the eternal intellect and power of God created the life and order of all things.  Is it reasonable to continually violate one’s own conscience, or do we allow our impulses and desires to override and suppress our thought processes? The very idea of “violating one’s conscience” necessarily implies an admission that what we are doing is “wrong” rather than “right”- at least as far as we understand them. So, why do we continually do that which contradicts our own understanding and thought processes? Surely such is “unreasonable” behavior! Note 1John 3:21-22 in this regard, “Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; and whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight.”   Is it reasonable to expect God to judge us on the basis of our emotional attachment to Him alone, or is that just what we want to believe? There is no doubt or argument that God desires and expects us to love Him, but is it reasonable to conclude that this is all that He expects? Was that all He did for us- just love us? Or, did He also act in our best interest? He not only loved us, He provided a way to save us through Jesus Christ, cf. Roman 5:8 ; John 3:16 . But is it reasonable to conclude that all we have to do is love Him in order to be saved eternally? What did Jesus say? Note His words on this point in John 14:15 , “If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.” And also, John 14:23 , “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him…”   In 2Thessalonians 3:2 , Paul asked the Thessalonians to pray that he and those with him might “be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men, (KJV).

As far as I can find, they are mentioned only once, and even then not much more than their names are given- except for one significant detail. The text of Acts 17:34 indicates that, at hearing the gospel preached by Paul at Athens, they “joined him and believed…”   Although the verse also indicates that there were others who likewise accepted the gospel’s invitation and obeyed, these two are mentioned by name. What a legacy!  After Paul had fled from the Jews of Thessalonica who had pursued him to Berea, he waited for Timothy and Silas in Athens. This was a unique place. The city was filled with philosophers and self-proclaimed thinkers, cf. Acts 17:18,20-21 . These folks prided themselves as being “on the cutting edge” of modern conceptual thought. Such obviously did not deter Paul. When given the opportunity to speak, he used their own superstitious and philosophical natures to teach them about the one true God, and the salvation He affords all men through Jesus Christ.  However, for our purposes, let’s concentrate more upon the reactions than the message this time. There were three distinction reactions to Paul’s sermon, which also parallel reactions to the gospel today. Let’s notice them.   Some sneered at the gospel,  “Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some began to sneer…”  Acts 17:32a . Evidently, their own “wisdom” ( cf. 1Cor.1:18ff ) was not offended when Paul showed the folly of their ignorant idolatry to an “Unknown God,”  vv.22-27 ; or his explanation of the true nature of God, vv.28-29 ; or even his pressing of their need of repentance in preparation for a coming judgment, vv.30-31 ; but could not stand his suggestion of a hope beyond death through resurrection, vv.31-32 ! The arrogant pride of their own conclusions caused them to sneer at anything other than a completely carnal view of life- that death was the complete cessation of all life and all hope. What a miserable view, and way to live! Paul told the Corinthians that those who hoped in this life only were “of all men most to be pitied,”  1Corinthians 15:19 . These sneering Athenians were far too smart to believe such a message of hope and salvation!   Some delayed at the preaching of the gospel, saying, “We shall hear you again concerning this,”  Acts 17:32b . Perhaps they were not yet completely convinced. Perhaps they liked and even believed what they heard, but were not yet fully ready to commit to the changes the gospel required. Perhaps they were just putting Paul off to avoid having to make a decision. Sadly, the divine record does not expound on their motives for delaying- just that they did. But it does say, in the next verse, that “Paul went out of their midst,” ( v.33 ); and then unfortunately adds that “After these things he left Athens and went to Corinth,”  Acts 18:1 . The point is that there is no indication in the text that these delayers in Athens, whatever their reason for hesitation, ever had another opportunity to hear the gospel…or to obey and be saved by it. The Roman governor Felix had a similar reaction to the truth, “Go away for the present, and when I find time, I will summon you, “  Acts 24:25 . Again, there is no mention in the text of that next time ever coming. The truth of Isaiah 55:6 rings clearly, “Seek the Lord while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near.” Indeed, there is great danger in delay. A man I know pretty well says, “Conclusions have consequences, so does indecision.”   Some also believed,   “But some men joined him and believed, among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them,”  Acts 17:34 . The word “join” is translated from the Greek term kallao, which literally means, “to glue, to glue together, cement, fasten together,” ( Enhanced Strong’s Lexicon ). The idea is that these people, once presented with the gospel of salvation by Paul, clung to him and would not let go. They stayed with him until they heard sufficient teaching to believe and obey the gospel. This is a remarkable contrast to the disinterested disdain of some, and the dispassionate delay of others in Athens.  The question that remains is this: How are you reacting to the Gospel? Will you be numbered and named with Dionysius and Damaris, or counted with the transgressors who sneered and delayed?"],"title":["Dionysius and Damaris"],"_resultNumber":207,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/dionysius_and_damaris","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":207},{"body":["We typically have several mental pictures of Satan. The Bible depicts him in various ways: the Serpent of Genesis 3 ; the Roaring Lion of 1Peter 5:8 ; the Dragon of Revelation ; the Wolf of John 10:12 ; and of course, the Devil, and many other proper names and descriptions. If Satan would just appear to us in these visibly obvious forms, he would be so much easier to identify and avoid! But he doesn’t- he’s much more subtle than that, cf. 2Corinthians 11:3 .  Even when Satan does announce his presence in overt ways, his approach is typically understated and shrewd, rather than bold and brash. There is, however, one characteristic of Beelzebul ( Matthew 12:24 ) that is often overlooked in our assessments of his nature: Satan is an  opportunist.  Note Luke 4:13 in this regard, “And when the devil had finished every temptation (of Jesus, PCS) , he departed from Him until an opportune time .” After three ‘swings and misses’ wherein he attempted to derail Jesus by getting Him to submit to his will rather than God’s, Satan retreated and waited for an opportune time to try again. This is exactly what an opportunist does, because it is easier. An opportunist is not always lazy, but he is definitely willing to wait for the times and circumstances when his intended victim is the most susceptible and vulnerable.  Think about it: when did Satan first attempt to entice Jesus to sin? The previous event in the chronology of Jesus’ life was His baptism, Luke 3:21-22 . This marked the beginning of His public ministry, Luke 3:23 . Obviously, Jesus’ baptism is not completely analogous to our own, but there is a comparative point to be made from it. When we are baptized into Christ ( cf. Galatians 3:26-27 ), we are born again as new creatures/babes,  John 3:3-5 ; 2Corinthians 5:17 . Spiritual babies are vulnerable. They have not yet matured to the point of having good resistance to the inducements of sin. They have likewise not fully developed the ability to “have their senses trained to discern good and evil” ( Hebrew 5:14 ). It is often then that Satan pounces in an effort to regain what He has lost to Christ- our souls! He is an opportunistic predator, and as such, seeks out the new, the weak, and the vulnerable precisely because they are easier to “catch!”  Let’s take this a step further with a question for your consideration: When was the “opportune time” for which Satan waited to entice Jesus again? While he certainly doesn’t quit trying to indirectly influence those who would follow Jesus, the next direct attempt in the record of the gospels seems to be Luke 22:3 , “And Satan entered into Judas…”  John 13:2 chronicles the same effort as, “And during the (last, PCS) supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas… to betray Him…” I find it interesting that Satan’s most targeted efforts to thwart Jesus from His saving purposes were at the very beginning and very end of His public ministry. We already extrapolated a reason for the initial salvo, but such also begs the question: Why at the end?  Perhaps the answer again has to do with Satan’s opportunistic tendencies. Having been initially unsuccessful at tempting Him, Satan sought to undermine Jesus’ efforts to save mankind from eternal damnation by attacking, again, when He was vulnerable. If Satan could make Jesus’ sacrificial death for our sins so agonizingly horrible that He would succumb to the temptation to avoid it altogether, he could still win.  There can be no doubt that Jesus’ moment of greatest temptation was on that night of His betrayal. Luke records His words of petition then as, “Father, if Thou art willing, remove this cup from Me...”  Luke 22:42 . The “cup” to which Jesus referred was the suffering of the cross, and it definitely was a temptation to Him- “And being in agony He was praying very fervently; and His sweat became like drops of blood, falling down upon the ground” ( Luke 22:44 ). The human side of Jesus did not want to die in agony any more than would you or I. But alas (and thankfully), even in His hour of greatest vulnerability, Jesus did not surrender to Satan’s efforts!  What have we learned? If Satan was opportunistic enough to tempt the very Son of God at His perceived points of greatest vulnerability, he will certainly do the same to us!  “But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world,”  1Peter 5:9 . How? Do what Jesus did when He was tempted: 1) turn to God’s word for answers, Matthew 4:4,6,10 ; and, 2) turn to God in prayer for strength to overcome, Luke 22:42 !"],"title":["The Ultimate Opportunist"],"_resultNumber":208,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/the_ultimate_opportunist","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":208},{"body":["While I don’t consider myself grossly overweight, I certainly could stand to lose a few pounds- a fact one of my doctors noted (and commented on!) recently. Such things got me to thinking about dieting....  Do you know why dieting usually doesn’t work? I’m no nutritional expert, but it really doesn’t take one to figure out the problem. Most dieting doesn’t work because of the mindset we take into the process. We like, and therefore desire, what is “bad” for us instead of that which is “good.” Realizing this, in various ways we attempt to restrict our intake of the things we really want, rather than changing the objects of our desires. Put another way, we continue to want the same things that got us into the shape we’re in- which is round, overweight, and unhealthy. Therefore, we feel deprived, and wind up wanting the “bad” stuff even more. The results are all too easy to predict.  What if, on the other hand, we could learn to enjoy the things that are actually good for us? Wouldn’t losing the weight then become easy? If would change our minds to actually desire that which is best for us, the extra pounds would disappear naturally. This “easy” solution to dieting requires one key element: we have to learn to desire and enjoy the things that are the good for us!  I’m not a weight-loss counselor, and this isn’t a healthy-eating article either. But Christians often have the exact same problem losing the extra weight of sin ( Hebrews 12:1 , KJV) which makes our spiritual lives so much more difficult, or even short-lived.  Here’s what often happens. Through the godly influence of a friend, or some tragedy in our lives, we decide to “get right” with God. Our minds and hearts are moved to understand and obey the gospel, so we confess our belief that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and are baptized for the remission of our sins, cf. Mark 16:16 ; Acts 2:37-38 . But if we’re not careful to continue to grow in the faith, soon the initial emotional high of salvation is worn down and overcome by the sinful desires of our previous life. This is exactly what Jesus described in the parable of The Sower ( Luke 8:13 ), “And those on the rocky soil are those who, when they hear, receive the word with great joy; and these have no firm root; they believe for a while, and in time of temptation fall away.” What went wrong? The heart/mind was not transformed and renewed ( see Romans 12:2 ) to feel and think differently; and therefore to desire the “good” things of our new life instead of the “bad” things of our old one. But how do we do that?   First, we realize that God’s way is best- which means we recognize in our minds that Christ’s intention was not for our restriction and misery, but that we might “have life, and have it more abundantly,”  John 10:10 . His requirements are not “burdensome” ( 1John 5:3 ), but when obeyed, instead provide us with the very best of this life, as well as the life that is to come.   Second, we decide to love what is good. Some might protest, “But I can’t control my heart- what I like or love. It just happens!” This is patently wrong, and is probably the romanticized idea of love which comes from Hollywood. Truthfully, it is a failure to “Watch over your heart with all diligence,”  Proverbs 4:23 . We decide what we will like, and what, or who, we will love. The decision may be subconscious, but it is a decision nonetheless. The key is to decide, by conscious effort, what will appeal to us- what we will value and love, both in things and people.   And finally, we simply do what our minds understand to be good, and what our hearts have been trained to love.  Transforming our lives into conformity with God’s will is easy once we’ve renewed our minds to understand what is best, and retrained our hearts to desire it. Then, we’re not just “loving what is good” ( Titus 1:8 ), we actually enjoy doing it. See? That’s as easy as pie.

Around these parts, beef is king and mutton is disdained- but that’s speaking both “agri” and “culturally” instead of spiritually.   Biblically, sheep are the farm animal chosen to represent “the flock” of God, Matthew 25:32ff ; et al . And as much as we like cattle around here, remember there are other even less-attractive barnyard critters that could have been selected to represent Christians, cf. Matthew 7:6 (hogs) and 2Peter 2:16 (a dumb donkey)! So, as much as we East-Texans might prefer cattle, the Lord evidently thought sheep were better representatives of what Christians ought to be. Have you ever wondered why?   Sheep are led, cattle are driven.  It’s not done around here much anymore, but we’ve all seen the iconic cattle drives where hoopin’ and hollerin’ cowboys herd cattle the way they want them to go with ropes and bullwhips and horses. But John 10:27 depicts a very different image, “My sheep hear My voice…. and they follow Me.” We need to remember this when attempting to bring people to Christ- you must lead (persuade to follow, cf. Acts 19:8 ) rather than drive them!   Sheep follow the shepherd , cattle follow the feed sack . Sheep are shy and finicky creatures. They won’t follow just anyone. Notice also John 10:4-5 on this point, “When he puts forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. And a stranger they simply will not follow, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.” Cows, on the other hand, will follow anyone with a feed sack or hay bale! The people “following” Jesus in John 6:26 were cattle, not sheep! Of them, Jesus said, “you seek Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.” Yep, there are still a bunch of these feedbag-chasing rawhides around whose primary interest in God seems to be filling their bellies with either food or fun, cf. Philippians 3:19 .   Sheep have to be led, cattle can be stampeded .  John 10:1-5ff also speaks of the “fold of the sheep.” Since this is cow country, a “sheep fold” is something with which we may not be familiar. Individual shepherds would, in the time and place of Jesus, lead their flock to pasturage and water during the day, but would bring their sheep into a common “fold” or pen at night for safekeeping. There was only one “door” (gate) of the fold, which would be guarded to prevent theft, or loss due to predators. Then the next morning, each shepherd would come to the door and call his sheep, and they, recognizing his voice, would come out of the fold and follow him, while all the other sheep remained in the pen until their shepherd called them. It really is a beautiful and fitting image of Christians’ relationship with the Chief Shepherd, Jesus. Cattle, on the other hand, can be stampeded by anyone who makes enough noise to spook them into running, often to their own and others’ destruction- which is not a pretty picture, but it, too, is spiritually accurate, cf. 2Peter 2 !  Most of the people I know around East Texas love beef and would have to be half-starved to death to lap a lip over mutton. But when it comes to things spiritual, we better all be “sheep-loving” and “Shepherd-following” wooly-buggers instead of cows!"],"title":["Sheep or Cattle?"],"_resultNumber":210,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/sheep_or_cattle","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":210},{"body":["“If-Then” statements are exactly what the name implies. They are statements wherein a truth is expressed in conditional terms. In algebra, an example of an “If-Then” statement would be, “If D is between C and E, then CD + DE = CE.” Computer programming also uses “If-Then” statements extensively. If a certain condition is met, then the program proceeds in one direction; if the condition is not met, then the program does nothing, looks for other conditions, and/or proceeds in an alternate direction. Years ago, when working for a motorhome production company in Nacogdoches, I used “If-Then” electrical relays (though they weren’t really called such) to control the functions of the coach, as well as the computers which controlled the engine, transmission, and systems on the unit. “If-Then” statements are everywhere!  The New Testament also utilizes “If-Then” statements. Consider carefully the words of Jesus in John 8:31 , “Jesus was therefore saying to those Jews who had believed in Him, ‘  If  you abide in My word,  then  are you truly disciples of Mine…’” Notice a few key parts of the conditional truth which He expresses. The Jews to whom Jesus spoke already believed, but were not made disciples by their belief alone. How do we know this? If their belief alone produced discipleship, why would Jesus make it conditional to the yet unmet requirement of “abiding in My word”? Such makes no sense if believing is all that is necessary to true discipleship.  The “If-Then” statement of Jesus above is well-illustrated in John 12:42-43 , where Jewish rulers “believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing Him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue; for they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of God.” In both cases, people believed in Jesus, and yet were not disciples because they failed to act on their belief. In other words, they did not meet the condition(s) of Jesus’ “If-Then” statement.  But let’s return to the text of John 8 for additional considerations. In v.32 , Jesus completes the sentence which He began with the “If-Then” statement of v.31 . Let’s put it all together to be sure we get the picture, “  If  you abide in My word,  then  you are truly disciples of Mine;  and  you shall know the truth,  and  the truth shall make you free.” Here we see two additional statements added which are both dependant on the previously stated condition. Both statements are thus made likewise provisional on the previous condition being met. In other words,  if  one is willing to “abide in My (Jesus’) word,”   then  and only then, will he be a true disciple through knowing the truth, and thus be made free by the truth. So, grammatically and spiritually speaking, the three results of being a disciple, knowing the truth, and being made free by the truth, are all conditional upon one being willing to abide, or live, within Jesus’ words. Simply put,  if  we aren’t willing to obey Jesus’ words in our lives,  then  we will not be His disciples; we will not come to know the truth; and we will not be made free by the truth. Thus, the only truth which saves is truth which is both known and lived.   Now we have the basics of “If-Then” statements down, consider also these other New Testament examples: “But  if  you do not forgive others,  then    your Father will not forgive your transgressions,”  Matthew 6:15 ; “  If  My kingdom were of this world,  then  My servants would be fighting…but as it is, My kingdom is not of this realm,”  John 18:36 ; “for  if  righteousness comes through the Law (“of Moses” is the context, PCS),   then    Christ died needlessly,”  Galatians 2:21 ; “  if  anyone is not willing to work,  then  he is not to eat either,”  2Thessalonians 3:10 ; “But  If  you are without discipline…  then  you are illegitimate children and not sons,”  Hebrews 12:8 .  Obviously, “If-Then” statements are not only prevalent in most facets of our lives, they are vitally important to our lives, and our salvation.

Though we all claim to believe in the same God, the same Savior, and the same Spirit- who are all “One” by the way ( John 17:11,21,23 ), we are divided into various denominations and sects. Given these things, how do we get back to where we’re supposed to be? How do we become again the “one body” ( cf. Ephesians 4:4 ) God created and intended?  While I’ve never portended to have “all” the answers, in this case, I have at least considered the question. Therefore, it seems to me that there are some fundamental principles which must be observed and obeyed if we are to ever become united.  First, we must believe that the Bible is God’s Word. You say most of us already believe that? Really? While most everyone agrees that it is “impossible for God to lie” ( Hebrews 6:18 ), they apparently do not believe all that He said either. For instance, some doubt what He said about a literal six days of creation. They have succumbed to Darwinian pressure and have retreated to Theistic Evolution’s supposed blending of science and faith. Theistic Evolution says that although God did indeed create the things Genesis says He did, He did so with gaps of perhaps millions of years between these six “days.” Is that what God said in Exodus 20:11 ? What sense did it make for Jews to commemorate and keep the seventh day as a Sabbath if there were millions of years between each of the six days of creation? You see, “we” don’t all really believe the Bible is God’s Word! And if we can’t even agree on how we got here from God’s Word, how will we ever agree on how to be united here from God’s Word?  But the Bible   is   God’s Word, cf. 2Timothy 3:16-17 ; and He is directly responsible for its contents, 1Corinthians 2:10-13 . We’ve already seen that men’s words divide us, so surely we can see that only God’s Word can unite us. Thus, to become “one,” we must cast aside all the doctrines and dogmas of men, and believe and use the Bible alone as our standard of faith and practice.  Second, we must eliminate relativism and subjectivism from the process of understanding and applying God’s Word. In the context of biblical interpretation (and therefore application), “relativism” is the notion that Truth is not absolute, and is thus always relative to some particular frame of reference, such as current culture and/or moralities. Such could lead one to conclude, regarding some point of doctrine, “That may be true (right or wrong) for you, but is not necessarily true for me.” Thus, we’ve made God’s Word relative to ourselves, cp.1Corinthians 10:13a .   Subjectivism is akin to relativism in its effect. Subjectivism says that Truth is subject to my own interpretation of it. This is patently not true! While the application of Truth is subject to my interpretation of it- I can’t apply it correctly if I don’t understand it correctly; the Truth itself is not subject to my understanding of it. It’s still true whether I correctly understand and apply it or not, cp. Matthew 22:29 !  These two notions of relativism and subjectivism combine to produce a major hindrance to unity: the idea that we can “understand” the Bible differently, and therefore apply it differently, and still be pleasing to God. This simply is not true. One may understand, and another may misunderstand; or, both may misunderstand, but two cannot understand the Truth differently. Why? Because truth is neither relative nor subjective!  1Corinthians 14:37 (KJV), “For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.”   Finally, and as a conclusion of the previous two points, we must decide that Truth matters- and act accordingly. The notion that Truth is somehow secondary to science (man’s knowledge) and society (man’s wisdom) is absolutely counterproductive to unity. As long as we believe and espouse that “It doesn’t really matter what you believe as long as you’re honest and sincere,” then true unity is impossible- not to mention salvation. This logic and reasoning makes impotent the very thing that can unite us: God’s Word. We’ve replaced the credibility and power of God’s Word with our own knowledge and wisdom. Surely we can all see that such just cannot ( Jeremiah 10:23 ), and thus will not, work. True unity must be firmly founded on, and only on, God’s Word!"],"title":["Uniting Believers: What Will It Take?"],"_resultNumber":212,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/uniting_believers_what_will_it_take","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":212},{"body":["Though it is not exactly how the dictionary defines it, we sometimes use the word “settle” as a verb meaning  to resolve by lowering standards   . Unfortunately, perhaps the most common usage of the word in this way has to do with choosing a mate.  For example, let’s say we have certain ideals and standards (whatever they may be- the specifics of which are not really the point at this time) that we think are important in a spouse. But after a few years of unsuccessful searching, we begin to lower those standards, or wind up abandoning them altogether to marry someone who… well, to put it bluntly, would say “yes” to us. In the process of making that decision, we created a conflict in our conscience because we knew we were doing something that we didn’t think was completely right. Unfortunately, we chose to “settle” this conflict of conscience by compromising the standards. The standards were lowered or abandoned because it was just plain easier. Instead of continuing to search for “Mr. / Mrs. Right,” we settled for “Mr. / Mrs. Right Now.” (Please understand, this is not a personal example- I married young because I didn’t want Donna to get old enough to realize that she could do a lot better than me!)  From that hypothetical example, which I fear happens all too often, let’s make some spiritual applications on this matter of “settling” conflicts of conscience by compromising the standards:   “I know this is not right, but it is the lesser of evils.”  In this scenario, we’re again attempting to salve our conflicted conscience by compromising the standard. We admit that both potential choices are “evil,” but propose to “settle” the matter by choosing the one which is less evil. Why not instead continue to pray and search for the “right” option? The Holy Spirit says there always is one, “but with the temptation (God) will provide the way of escape also, that you may be able to endure it.” ( 1Corinthians 10:13b . This means that God will never leave us with nothing but “wrong” choices- there will always be a “right” thing to do! So don’t “settle” such a conflict of conscience by choosing the “lesser of evils,” continue to look for, find, and then take the “right” path!   “I am this (denomination), but my spouse is this (denomination), so we just go there (a 3 rd denomination).” What did that resolve? Instead for searching for and finding the “right” thing to do (see the previous paragraph and passage again), both parties compromised their conscience by lowering their standards- they “settled”! So, they both wind up attending a church with which they do not agree doctrinally rather than searching for, finding, and taking the “right” option based on the standard of God’s word, Ephesians 4:4-6 .   “We can’t really understand the Bible anyway.” What is often behind such a statement as this is a conflict of conscience caused by a lack of understanding. Because one has not put forth the effort to study and understand the Bible, and is not willing to do so, the resulting conflict of conscience is “settled” by, again, lowering the standard- saying it (the Bible) can’t be understood. Think: Why would the Creator provide us with a book which illuminates the path to heaven in words that we cannot understand? To suggest that God did this is nigh unto, if not altogether, blasphemy! Listen to the Word of the Holy Spirit through the Apostle Paul, “that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery (meaning, the previously un revealed - PCS) , as I wrote before in brief. And by referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,”  Ephesians 3:3-4 . Don’t “settle” the conflict(s) of your conscience by retreating to “you can’t understand the Bible anyway”- do the “right” thing like Ezra. He “set his heart to study the law of the Lord, and to practice it, and to teach His statutes and ordinances…”  Ezra 7:10 . And you can do it too, if you won’t “settle”!

Although I work at the task, I fear my efforts often fall woefully short.  We are told that a high percentage of our communication is “non-verbal.” This supposedly refers to body language such as hand gestures, overall posture and facial expressions, rather than “texting” or “tweeting.” But words are still the primary “vehicles of thought” in any language, or form of that language. English (and other languages as well), properly understood and utilized, can convey messages with amazing specificity. For instance, we might use “infer” and “imply” synonymously, but we would be wrong to do so. To “imply” something is to suggest it without specifically stating it. But to “infer” is to conclude something that has not been specifically stated. These two are actually on opposite ends of the same process. You “imply” something, and from your words I “infer” a conclusion- all without anything being specifically stated!  The uncanny power of words is not accidental. The first man did not have to grunt and gesture with non-opposable-thumbed hands for centuries while evolving. He was spoken to immediately and intelligently by His Creator, and responded with an intellectual prowess invested within him by that Creator ( Genesis 1:27-28ff ). And both used words! Words were as much a gift from God as the ability to creatively produce and perceptively receive them.  But these words were not just a part of God’s creative gift to Adam so that he could talk to his wife (yes, that began there in the Garden also ladies). God wanted a way to be able to communicate His will to man, and man needed to be able to express himself to God, cf. Genesis 2:16-17,23 .  Initially, and for hundreds of years, God spoke to the heads, or patriarchs , of families through dreams and visions, or even directly, to reveal His wishes to man. This is what is commonly called the Patriarchal Period of biblical history. Then beginning at Mt. Sinai, Jehovah used codified words to communicate His Law to Israel. He gave those laws through His prophet, Moses. Therefore, that dispensation is referred to as the Mosaical Period because God communicated His laws primarily through Moses, though other prophets were also utilized. Hebrews 1:1 described these periods this way, “God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways…”   Then, in the first century (A.D.), God began to reveal His laws to all mankind through Christ, “in these last days has spoken to us in His son…”  Hebrews 1:2 . Therefore, and logically, this is referred to as the Christian Period. But God didn’t speak to man just through Christ, He also utilized the Holy Spirit to reveal His will to mankind. In fact, the word “inspired” is from the Greek theopneustos, which is a compound word derived from theos (God) + pneo (breath). Thus literally, “inspired” means “God-breathed” in the New Testament.  From these things, a couple of points need to be made. The inspiration of the New Testament was very specific in that the words were carefully guarded by the Holy Spirit to ensure that they conveyed the thoughts of God to the minds of men. Note 1Corinthians 2:12-13 on this point, “Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things freely given to us by God, which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those (meaning, words ) taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words.” As such,the words of the Bible matter because they were specifically chosen to reveal God’s will to man! Therefore, we shouldn’t alter them ( Gal.1:6-8 ); add to or subtract from them ( Rev.22:18-19 ); or ignore them ( Heb.2:2-4 ); because they will be the words by which we are judged when life is over ( John 12:48 ).  Biblical words and their meanings matter because eternity hangs in the balance.

For decades, toddlers went to what was commonly referred to as “Little Class” with Sister Ruby Johnson . “Mrs. Ruby,” as the children all knew her, had a special love for and way with the youngest of the church’s bible class students. I know she had many second-generation students, and may have even had some third-generation ones also. She has such a wonderful spiritual legacy of young lives positively influenced for the cause of Christ. To this day, when I visit that congregation (now “Stallings Drive”), Mrs. Ruby still gets a big hug every time!  One of the songs we sang in Mrs. Ruby’s Little Class was “Oh Be Careful Little Eyes.” It went something like, “Oh be careful little  eyes  what you  see  , for the Father up above is looking down in love, oh be careful little  eyes  what you  see  .” The second and third verses repeated with “ears/hear” and “mouth/say” inserted for “eyes/see.” Of course, there were hand gestures that coincided with the words also. It was, and is, a wonderful diminutive ditty for the pint-sized, but contains a magnificent mantra for the man-sized too!  Self-control is one of the so-called “Christian graces” of 2Peter 1:6 , and is also part of the “fruit of the Spirit” highlighted in Galatians 5:23 . It is what “Oh Be Careful Little Eyes” is really all about. The term “self-control” is self-explanatory, and needs no definitions from Greek or English for us to comprehend. Understanding “self-control” is obviously not the difficult part- implementing it is another matter! But that little song has it right: if we can just control our eyes, ears, and mouths, the rest pretty much follows.  Think about the importance of self-control with regard to our eyes- what we see . Jesus said that “The lamp of the body is the eye; if therefore your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light,”  Matthew 6:22-23 . He also said the inverse is true, “But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness.” It’s no wonder that Job declared, “I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I gaze at a virgin?” ( Job 31:1 ) Job evidently understood the warning verbalized by Jesus much later in Matthew 5:28 that “everyone who looks on a woman to lust for her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.” To understand the full ramifications of Jesus’ words, also consider 1Corinthians 6:9 and Hebrews 13:4 , which both indicate that those guilty of such will miss heaven. “Oh be careful little (and big) eyes what you see”- Matthew 13:13-17 !  Self-control, or the lack of it, also manifests itself with regard to our ears- what we hear . Certainly, one cannot always control that which is seen or heard, but such inadvertent or accidental “hearing” or “seeing” is not really the point. King David likely “accidently” first saw Bathsheba bathing herself, but this wasn’t the real problem. His continual looking, inquiring after her, and sending for her became the problem(s)! So too it is with hearing: it is not the unintentional hearing of something that we shouldn’t that typically gets us into to trouble. Instead, it is the deliberate listening to gossip ( 1Timothy 5:13 ), the filth of dirty jokes and entertainment ( Ephesians 5:3-4 ), and other things to which a child of God has no business listening to that causes problems. “Oh be careful little (and big) ears what you hear”- Romans 10:17 !  Perhaps nowhere is self-control more difficult, or more needed, than in regard to our tongues- what we say.  James has much to say about both the power and danger of the tongue: “But no one can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil and full of deadly poison,”  James 3:8ff . Self-control in regard to the tongue sounds hopeless. However, it is important to realize that James is not saying the tongue is uncontrollable. He writes of the inability to “tame” it. “Taming” something implies that it can be trusted to do what one wants without constraint or compulsion. In this sense, our tongues can never be fully trusted and tamed. We must always maintain a “tight rein” on the tongue to “make” (rather than trust) it to behave. You know this already- as soon as you “loosen the reins” on your own tongue, the betrayal inevitably occurs. “Oh be careful little (and big) mouths what you say”- Matthew 12:36 !

The closest kid, not related to me, with which to play was either a goat, or a couple of miles away by bicycle or horseback. I had a brother and sisters, but they were all older. So much of my interaction with other children came at the little country school I attended. As children invariably do, we would get together on the playground, and someone would suggest that we play a game. It was usually some sort of made-up game with rules that were likewise invented and added as we went along. So, the rules were always ill-conceived and inadequate to give any real structure to the game, which was OK since we were just kids playing. But then, and it usually didn’t take too long, as it became apparent to everyone that the rules of the game were not thought-out too well (and often designed to give the author some definite advantage), someone would suggest that we just play the game “with no rules”- which soon ended the game.  This little story illustrates a fundamental principle of human behavior: Any cooperative effort requires some form of rules to provide structure, and shape interaction toward the goal. In other words, we humans require rules to function constructively. This need comes from our creation. We were created by a God of order and design, not confusion and chaos ( 1Cor.14:33 ). He designed and constructed the Universe to operate on the basis of laws which provide order and harmonious interaction. He created man the same way- with a need for operating principles, or laws.  Throughout man’s history, his own efforts to generate these operating principles have often resulted in really bad laws, kind of like those playground game rules, cf. Jeremiah 10:23 . And this tendency invariably produces cries to “play without any rules,” just as it did on the playground- which is anarchy. Technically, anarchy is the absence of viable law, and therefore results in the absence of any system of organization. But God didn’t create the Universe, or man, to operate that way. The Psalmist says that the ways of man are “ordered by the Lord,”  37:23 .  And yet, despite our obvious need of the order and organization that laws provide, and despite our demonstrated lack of ability to effectively produce them ourselves (The Inquisition for example), we keep trending closer and closer to spiritual anarchy. We, in the religious world of today, seem to be distancing ourselves from the very concept of spiritual “law.” The notion that there is a “right” way to think soundly, to act morally, and to worship spiritually as determined by authority of God’s Word, is rapidly being replaced with “I think” and “we feel” reasoning. The road to complete spiritual anarchy is paved with such logic substituted for biblical authority.  If we hope to please God rather than just humoring our own humanity, we must realize that the God of order and design ordered and designed spiritual laws for our ultimate good. We can “play” at religion by believing, teaching, and doing the things we “think” and “feel”- and thus worship ourselves; or, we can order and arrange ourselves according to God’s laws- and worship Him. But we can’t do both. Instead of abandoning the Law of God for our own thoughts and wishes, we must test every doctrine, belief, and practice with, “What is written in the Law?” ( cf. Luke 10:26 ). Then, we must do “what is written in the Law!” Spiritual anarchy produces only the chaos of eternal destruction. But obedience to the law of God produces exactly what He ordered and designed: eternal life, James 1:22-27 ."],"title":["Spiritual Anarchy"],"_resultNumber":216,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/spiritual_anarchy","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":216},{"body":["Ephesians 5:15 (KJV), “See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise…” I’m not a big fan of the King James Version of the Bible.

None of the other major translations utilize this particular word; they instead generally use words which convey the idea of “walking carefully” - which is OK, I guess, but not as good as it could be. Let me explain further...    Circumspectly  is translated from two differing Greek terms:  blepo   , means to look or discern with the eye; and  akribos   , means diligently, exactly, or accurately. So, the literal meaning of circumspectly is that of  looking carefully  in order to be  fully aware of your circumstances  . In more simple terms, it means to pay attention where you’re stepping- which in this case, refers to our walk of life. Perhaps an illustration will help.  There is nothing that will ruin a good squirrel hunt quicker than for someone in the group to see a snake, or hear one rattle. The reason this ruins the hunt is simple: instead of looking up into the trees where the squirrels are, everyone is now watching the ground where the snakes are! The squirrel hunters are now hunting snakes instead of squirrels, but they’re walking circumspectly!  Every step, after seeing a snake, hearing one rattle, or even just hearing that someone nearby has seen one, will be taken only after a thorough examination the landing area.  If we further understand that Satan is “that old serpent” ( Revelation 12:9 ) who “beguiled Eve through his subtlety” ( 2Corinthians 11:3 ), then need for walking circumspectly is readily apparent. Satan has filled the pathway of life with many dangers. Therefore, for one desiring to please God in his walk of faith, every step must be carefully taken only after a diligent examination of the area into which he’s stepping. To do otherwise, as our verse in Ephesians 5:15 indicated, is “foolish” indeed. The problem is that Satan often pays closer attention to our steps than do we.  There is a sticky note stuck on the bottom of my computer screen on which I jotted a phrase, the source of which has been forgotten. The phrase is this: “falling through the cracks of my attention.” When building a floor, cracks (spaces) are put between the boards for a number of reasons, one of which is to cover more area with fewer boards. But this “stretching” of the wood also means an increased opportunity for things to fall through the cracks, or gaps, between the boards. Now think about our lives as that floor. We keep stretching the boards of our attention farther and farther apart in order to cover more area. But this also increases the opportunity for more and more things to “fall through the cracks of our attention.” Businessmen sometimes say that “the Devil is in the details” of their deals, but this Preacher says that “The Devil is also in the cracks between the boards of our attention!”  The less attention we pay to the steps we take on the boards of life on which we tread, the greater the opportunity Satan has to make us fall. And the more we try to stretch the boards of our attention by creating bigger cracks between them, the less “circumspectly” we will walk! That is “unwise” indeed. Folks, “walk circumspectly” and give heed to Ephesians 5:17 , “So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is”- there’s a Snake out there you know!"],"title":["Walking Circumspectly: Squirrels, Snakes, and Boards"],"_resultNumber":217,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/walking_circumspectly_squirrels_snakes_and_boards","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":217},{"body":["It should be abundantly clear that the Lord intended His people to be united-  “that they may all be one…”   John 17:21 . To that end, He gave us a platform to accomplish that unity: “There is one body and one Spirit , just as you were also called in one hope of your calling; one Lord , one faith , one baptism , one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.” ( Ephesians 4:4-6 ). But if He intended for us to be united, and gave us the necessary foundation to accomplish it, why are we so divided? Check the yellow pages under “Churches” for evidence of our divisiveness.  To say, “We’re all just taking different roads to the same place” is just not true. Jesus said there is but “one way/road”- not many different ones, cf. John 14:6; Matthew 7:13-14 . It has always been interesting to me that most who claim the “different roads to the same place” mantra are making an attempt at unity, but obviously don’t believe in the “one body” or “one baptism” or “one faith” concepts stated in Ephesians 4 necessary to produce it. So, let’s spend a moment attempting to really understand how and why these “ones” should unite us as God’s people the way He intended.  There being “one God” should provide us with unity in worship  , John 4:23 ; but we (‘religious’ folks in general) have decided that we should all be able to worship in “our own way,” so we are divided. There being “one Lord” should provide us with unity in authority  , Matthew 28:18 ; but we have decided that “other authorities” (doctrines of men) are equally viable, and thus ought to be considered, so we are divided. There being “one faith” should provide us with unity in message  , Romans 1:16; 5:1-2 ; but we have decided that we need to “cater/mold the message” to this group or that mindset, so we are divided. There being “one baptism” should provide us with unity in birth  , John 3:3-5; Galatians 3:26-29 ; but we have decided that “baptism is important, but not essential,” and that it can be sprinkling or pouring water on anyone, rather than being the immersion of penitent believers, so we are divided. There being “one Spirit” should provide us with unity in vocation ,  Romans 8:2,7,12-14 ; but we have decided that the Spirit leads this person in “this” direction, and that person in “that” direction, so we are divided. There being “one hope” should provide us with unity in purpose  , Colossians 1:3-8 ; but we have decided that only some should hope for heaven, while others must be content to hope for some form of a perfected earth, so we are divided.  Get the picture? God provided us with everything we needed to be united as His people in worship, authority, message, birth, vocation, and purpose. But we, in our own “wisdom,” turned aside from these things, and are thus divided rather than united. What makes correcting this division more difficult is the misguided notions we have about how to go about it.  Ecumenicism (uniting differing religious groups through compromise and blending) is not the answer to religious division. The reason should be obvious: ecumenicism requires the compromise of beliefs and convictions regarding the truth. We cannot become united on the basis of compromise- we must become united on the basis of conviction that the Word of God is the only standard; and that as such, it must be the standard for everyone. Men writing doctrines and dogmas that outline how to be a member of this denomination or that one don’t unite- they divide, obviously. As such, all such writings of men have to be abandoned for a “thus says the Lord” with a book, chapter, and verse following. Unity can only be achieved by the correct understanding and application of the Truth- not the compromise of conviction and the forfeiture of faith. Otherwise, we will never be united, and will thus never be pleasing to God. “If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God…”  1Peter 4:11 ."],"title":["The Unity Problem"],"_resultNumber":218,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/the_unity_problem","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":218},{"body":["I hate green briars. I know were supposed to our reserve hate for only the things that God hates- but I hate green briars! When God cursed the ground because of Adam and Eve’s sin, He said, “…Cursed in the ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life. Both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you…” ( Gen3:17-18 ). When I read or think of this passage, I see green briars as being one of the results of this curse.    Having cleared a good deal of East Texas land in my time, my disdain for green briars comes naturally for me. They are a bane for such pursuits. They seem as tough as barbed wire to cut, and are just as dangerous, if not more so, dead than alive. I have taken a chain saw to bigger ones only to have the chain grab the vine in such a way that it jerks the needle-sharp thorns into me anyway! If you just cut them down at the ground, they’ll sprout right back up at the next good rain. The only way I know to get rid of them is to dig up that giant, bulbous, tuber-like root, and burn it.    But the worst is when there’s a whole bunch of them. They present such a tangled web that it is impossible to get through them without a blood-letting party taking place. Once in the midst of them, there just seems to be no escape that doesn’t involve torn clothing and pain.  They grab hold and dig in so that every way you turn, it just seems to get worse. Did I mention I hate green briars?     Recently, while helping a friend clear some land, we took almost gleeful pleasure in gathering up a bunch of individual green briar vines left by the brush rake, and watching them burn on the fire while they crackled and hissed- it was quite a vengeful, and perhaps sadistic, pleasure for us both! Besides, it’s the biblically-prescribed right thing to do with them, cf. Heb.6:8 .    But I hate green briars for another reason also. They, at least to me, seem to represent the tangled web of sin in which we sometimes find ourselves. We often don’t know exactly how we got into the big middle of such a mess, but everywhere we turn, there seems to be no way of escape- at least none which are free from the excise tax of pain and suffering. So what do we do if we find ourselves in such a situation?    Well, if green briars remind of us of the tangled web of sin, we ought to deal with sin the way we do with green briars. We could:      First, stop! If we find ourselves in the big middle of green briars or sin, the first thing to do is not go any further in! Unfortunately we sometimes think “If I just do this one more sin, though I know it’s not right, then I can get out of this mess.” Sin, or additional sin, is never the answer! Listen to Rom.6:1-2,15 , “Are we to continue in sin…may in never be!....Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? May it never be!”          Second, evaluate. Before we can ascertain the right thing to do to extricate ourselves, we need to assess and evaluate the situation. Knowing how to get out of sin usually requires understanding how you got in. The whole idea of “repentance” is a reversal of mind that leads to a reversal of course or direction- “Repent therefore and return that your sins may be wiped away…”  Acts 3:19 . We can’t “return” unless we know how we got to where we are.       Third, move cautiously but deliberately. When we “come to our senses” ( cf. Luke 15:17ff ) and realize that we’re in a tangled mess of green briars or sin, we can’t lose our heads and go thrashing about like a fish out of water (sorry for the mixed metaphors). After we’ve stopped and evaluated the situation, we have to deal with the most pressing needs first. In green briars, that means deal with the ones that are giving you the most pain, or pose the worst threat. The same is true for sin. Deal with the one that is the closest and most dangerous first. And do so one at a time. You can handle one green briar at a time fairly painlessly, but if you grab a whole bunch and try to rip them out of the ground, you’re going to bleed, and be unsuccessful to boot! So it is also true with “a bunch” of tangle sins- you have to handle them one at a time starting with the that has the biggest and most painful hold on you. Then you can, one by one, work your way free. Such is not to say that we are unable to make “wholesale changes” in our lives when it comes to sin, but we must realize that even this is usually best accomplished little by little with very careful, meticulous, and specific efforts.       Finally, get back to safe ground. Once freed from our entanglement (green briarsor sin), we have to move back to clear and safe ground or we will become entrapped all over again. Peter says it is even worse the second time around, “For if after having escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and are overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.” ( 2Pet.2:20 ) “Safety” in green briar terms is clear ground. “Safety” in sin terms is back on the solid and clear ground of living in obedience to the Word of God. Remember Peter’s words: the escape comes by knowledge . We cannot do the “right” thing unless we educate ourselves from the Word of God on what the “right” thing is. It is truly the only safe place to be.     Comparing green briars to sin may be a simple way of looking at things– but what are we to expect from a simple-minded fellow like me? Besides, didn’t the Lord often use the simple things of nature to teach far-reaching lessons of spiritual consequence? Anyway, I hope this down-to-the-earth look at things helps in some way. And watch out for those green briars and sin- entanglements in either sure do hurt."],"title":["Green Briars and the Tangled Web of Sin"],"_resultNumber":219,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/green_briars_and_the_tangled_web_of_sin","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":219},{"body":["My dad was a vocational agriculture teacher for 35 years. Given that there were four of us kids, he and mother had to be frugal with his teacher’s pay to make ends meet. I can remember him saying to me after I had fallen and skinned my knee, “Boy don’t tear your britches- that hide (meaning “skin”) will grow back on its own, but we have to buy those britches!” He was/is a great kidder also, and wasn’t nearly as calloused as that statement makes him sound.   But along the same lines, I also remember a very clear distinction being made in our home between “Sunday clothes” and “everyday/play clothes.” And since money was always tight, we kids didn’t dare get caught outside playing in the red dirt in our “Sunday clothes” because that meant a whipping for sure!   Sadly, it seems that the distinction between “play clothes” and “Sunday clothes” is rapidly disappearing. I’m old enough to still think that people who are going to worship the Creator of the Universe and study His holy word ought to look like that’s where they’re going and what they’re doing, instead looking like they’re going to play ball or cut the grass. Then too, I think that when we dress down too much, our attitude is affected. When we dress like we’re going to ball game, we tend to expect to be entertained, rather than expecting to give honor and praise to God through worship. But lest I get too carried away, let me get back on track.    There is an inverse problem that also exists in our churches today- even among many who still maintain a distinction between “Sunday clothes” and “everyday clothes.” They seem to forget that our “Sunday activity” is supposed affect our “everyday life”! Unfortunately, many seemingly take off their Christianity when they remove their “Sunday clothes.” Thus, going to church is something they might do even fairly consistently on “the Lord’s Day,” but Monday through Saturday is still all about them.    I recognize that Sunday is a “special day” for Christians. We assemble together to sing; pray; memorialize the Lord’s death, burial, and resurrection by partaking of communion; give a return of the Lord’s blessing of us through contribution; and “yes” we even listen to the preacher too. We don’t dedicate everyday to doing those things because some of them are specified acts of worship designated for the first day of the week (see 1Corinthains 11:18-34 ; 16:1-2 ; Acts 20:7 ). And then too, we do have to work to provide for our families, and need to spend some time recreating ourselves and them during the week as well. But the problem comes in when we so compartmentalize our lives that we forget God is still “God” Monday through Saturday! If we only pray, study God’s word, and think on things that are true, honorable, right, pure, lovely, of good repute, excellent, and praise-worthy (taken from Philippians 4:8 ) on Sunday, then we’re going to have a hard time being much of a Christian Monday through Saturday. What we’re doing in such cases is relegating God to only the Sundays of our lives. We’re taking off our religion when we take off our “Sunday” clothes….and that’s not what Jesus intended Christianity to be, nor how He intended it to affect us.    The Lord addressed the point in Matthew 6:25-33 . After telling His audience, which includes us, that all of our anxieties about physical things are really pointless, as in vv.25-32 , He then concludes that we should instead “seek first His kingdom, and His righteousness; and all these things will be added” to us. We don’t fulfill this command by just “putting on our Sunday clothes and going to church” on the first day of the week, and then taking them off and forgetting about God and Christianity again until next Sunday.    Some tend to think of Jesus’ admonition to “seek first the kingdom” as a list of priorities with God at the top. If so, we “go to church” Sunday morning, then we proudly check God off as being “first” in our lives, and then proceed through the rest of the list and week doing just as we please. Instead, try picturing “seeking first the kingdom” as a wagon wheel with God as the hub in the center. Next, think of the “spokes” of the wheel being all the other things that should and do occupy our time Monday through Saturday. Now all our “spokes” are still tied to God as the “center/priority,” of our lives. Thus everything we do, and every decision we make, still has God at the center! I think that’s more what Jesus had in mind, don’t you? This way, Christianity doesn’t come off with our “Sunday clothes”!    “Sunday clothes” are great for worship. But if we take them off, and put them, our Bibles, and our thoughts and activities of Christianity away until next Sunday, we might as well just have stayed home in the first place. Christianity that is taken off with our “Sunday” clothes, well, to paraphrase the Lord and put it in a colloquial style, “ain’t worth spit” (see His rebuke of the lukewarm folks in Laodicea, Revelation 3:15-16 ). Christianity has to be an “everyday” thing to be of any good to God or us."],"title":["“Sunday” vs. “Everyday” Things"],"_resultNumber":220,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/sunday_vs._everyday_things","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":220},{"body":["I have often said that “The greatest power of the human mind is the ability to justify self.” We humans have the uncanny ability to convince ourselves that some course of action is right, necessary, expedient, or just “the lesser of two evils” no matter how wrong it is- if it is what we really want to do in the first place...   The further the proposed activity is from what is right, the more prowess is summoned to be able to justify it. But we still manage, if we want it bad enough. (As an example of this ability, some can even justify the taking of an innocent, unborn human life because it is inconvenient to do otherwise.)  Actually, it is not that tough to justify “self” most of the time because the easiest person to deceive is always yourself, 1Corinthians 3:18 . It’s no wonder then that the New Testament includes the phrase  “Do not be deceived”  several times. The interesting thing is that almost every time the phrase is used, the specific subject addressed is something about which most everyone would say, “Well yeah, everyone knows that!” And yet the admonition is there anyway…because God knows how good we are at thinking that for some justifiable reason, the truth of what is being said doesn’t apply specifically to “me”! Let me show you what I mean.   1Corinthians 6:9-10 reads, “Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God.” Now why do we think that this applies to everyone but ourselves? When God says that homosexuals don’t go to heaven, He also said that fornicators, adulterers, thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers and swindlers don’t make it either! Please don’t misunderstand, God will forgive any sin from which we will repent and turn, Acts 3:19 . But we cannot continue to practice any sin and expect God to save us “in” our sin, Luke 13:1-5 . Folks, please don’t be deceived about who goes to heaven and who doesn’t!   1Corinthians 15:33 reads,  “Do not be deceived:   ‘Bad company corrupts good morals.’” The specific “bad company” of which Paul warns the Corinthian brethren is false teachers (who said that there isn’t a resurrection of the dead, v.12 ). But the general truth of this statement is agreed upon by just about everyone… again unless it is being applied to “me.” “Oh I know ‘bad company corrupts good morals,’ but this is different because I’m going to influence them for good.” Perhaps- but again, why does the truth of God’s word apply to everyone but “me”? Paul had already written to these same Corinthians, “Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.” ( 10:13 ) We worry about the bad company our children keep, but somehow think the rule is suspended for us. Don’t be deceived about the power of influence.   James 1:13-16 reads, “Let no one say when he is tempted, ‘I am being tempted by God’; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt any one. But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust. Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death. Do not be deceived my beloved brethren.” God doesn’t tempt us to sin, period. He issues commands- either positive or negative, and we either obey or disobey them because that’s what we want to do! And for those of you old enough to remember Flip Wilson, contrary to what he always said, “The devil does not make us do it” either. Oh sure, Satan will help and encourage us to violate God’s law whenever he can ( cf. Gen.3:4-5 ), but the true culprit of sin is “self”! That is, our own desires and lusts cause us to: ignore what God says; rebelliously turn away from what God says; or in some way excuse ourselves from doing what God says. Then we sin precisely because that’s what we want to do. But neither God nor Satan make us do it. So don’t be deceived about exactly who is responsible for your sin. Just look in the mirror to find the answer.  While there are other passages and examples that could be given, perhaps these three will suffice to make my point: God’s Word is true, and it applies to each and every one of us equally. “…God is not one to show partiality, but in every nation the man who fears Him and does what is right, is welcome to Him.” ( Acts 10:34b-35 ) None of us is excepted or otherwise excused from doing the very best we can to do exactly what He says.

In the first case, we typically think “it” (whatever “it” is) will make us happy. In the latter case, we know that regardless of whatever else of a material nature that we have or don’t have, our families bring us true joy and happiness.    I have previously said, as have many other preachers, that getting married changes a man. Up to that point, he has been largely concerned with only himself. But now that the “love bug” has bitten him, there is someone that he actually cares more about than himself. So now he starts saying and doing things that he thinks will please or impress “her” in efforts to gain her attention and affections. If successful, marriage takes place and a new family is initiated. Marriage, and thus “family,” has changed him for the better. He’s not so self-centered now that he has a wife.  But if and when that holy union is blessed with a child, that man is changed again– immeasurably so! His becoming married changed him by adding responsibility, which he gladly accepted. He was no longer interested in spending his time, energy, and money on just entertaining himself (and his buddies), he was now concerned with providing for his wife ( 1Tim.5:8 ), and pleasing her ( 1Cor.7:33 ), which is the responsibility he accepted when he said, “I do.” But while becoming married added responsibility, having a child added a whole new dimension. His wife brought responsibilities to him and became his by her choice– but this baby   is his , and is utterly and completely dependent upon him! His wife can “take care of herself” if need be, but this tiny little baby that has his eyes, nose, forehead, etc. is totally reliant on him for everything- at least in his mind, and in the responsibility and family provision kind of way! As much as he loved his wife and was willing to sacrifice for her– even his own life, such is multiplied exponentially now with this “new addition” to the family. What changes have been wrought in this young man! Now he can’t wait for work to be over so he can rush home to be with his family! He can happily spend hours just sitting and watching his wife and their child with wonder, amazement, pride, and complete and utter joy. Yes, the blessings of “family” are surely immense.    However, this article isn’t just some nostalgic trip down memory lane. As great as our love of our families is, the Lord said in Luke 14:26 that, “If anyone comes to Me, and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, even his own life, he cannot be My disciple.” After understanding the true joy, blessings, and purpose that “family” brings to man, how could Jesus say such a thing? Is He anti-family? Not at all. God, the name of which certainly includes Jesus, instituted and provided “family” for man for his happiness and well-being, Gen.2:18-24 . The word Jesus used that is translated as “hate” is the Greek term “miseo.” It means “to love less.” As much as we love and cherish our families, we must love them less than we love God. As great as are our responsibilities to provide for and protect them, we have great responsibilities to serve God. But have you ever wondered why this must be so?    Much more than some man is “your father,” and you brought tremendous joy and pleasure to him by your mere arrival in the family, God is your Father. While your birth effected changes in your physical father, your heavenly Father has created the whole world for you to enjoy. His gifts to you included all the bounties of a wonderful world which we are given to enjoy, Gen.1:26-31 . But it didn’t end there– before Adam even breathed his first breath, God had a plan in place whereby we could not only enjoy the physical blessings of earthly provisions and family, we could also enjoy the spiritual blessings of spiritual provisions and spiritual family. We could become not just the physical result of divine parentage, we could become the spiritual offspring of God Himself, “See how great a love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God, and such we are…..”  1John 3:1 . In this way, “family”- and thus the joys and benefits of it, takes on a whole new meaning!    There is a significant difference, however, between your physical family and a potential spiritual one . With regard to being born into your physical family, you had absolutely no choice or even participation in the matter. Such is not so with entering the spiritual family of God. Its blessings, benefits, and inheritance is truly beyond words, but you have to decide to be a part of it, and are born into it of your own volition and action. All the planning and preparation has been done by a loving Father, and self-sacrificing Brother, and a ever-present assisting family Spirit, but you have become adopted ( Gal.4:5 ; Eph.1:5 ) by obedience through faith and baptism, J ohn 3:3,5 and Gal.3:26-29 .    So remember, as much as that boy or girl of yours has your physical features, we were all created “in the image of God”  Gen.1:26 . And as much joy and pride as you receive from your family, so much more is it true for God when we walk according to His guidance. “Family” is truly a blessing– both physical and spiritual . Even if we don’t have the benefit of the physical one, for whatever reason, we can all have the truly phenomenal blessings of being in the “family” of God!

The test was based on Matthew 6:19-21 and went something like this: “Do you love people and use things to help them? Or, do you love things and use people to get them?” I found this to be a very insightful way of self-determining the spirituality or carnality of the heart. While we would all like to think the best of ourselves, let us remember that we generally judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their actions. Though we would all like to think that we love people and use things as God directed, our actions often reveal a different reality about our affections.

Though the details are relatively unimportant for our purposes here, I got so wrapped up in “things” that I thought ought to be done and doing them, that I neglected some “people” that needed my help and attention. The “things” I thought needed doing were good and noble enough all right, but should not have been given priority over people who needed my encouragement. You see, this people vs. things problem can affect us all at times- which is why we must constantly examine ourselves ( 2Corinthians 13:5 ) with regard to our intentions and actions.  All of this reminds me of Martha in Luke 10 . As Jesus and His disciples travelled along toward to Jerusalem, they came to “a certain village” ( John 11:1 identifies it as Bethany) which was the home of Martha and her sister Mary. Martha welcomed the Lord and His disciples into her home, v.38 . Mary situated herself at Jesus’ feet and was evidently thoroughly engrossed with what He was teaching those assembled, v.39 . “But Martha was distracted with all her preparations,”  v.40 . That was me: distracted with things in preparation. Martha apparently became so frustrated with all there seemingly was to do, and with the lack of assistance that she was getting from her sister, that she finally complained to the Lord in the latter part of v.40 . But note carefully the Lord’s response in v.41 , “Martha, Martha, you are worried and bothered about so many things ....” Did you get that? Martha was worried and bothered about “things” instead the “person”- Jesus, the Christ! Mary, on the other hand, had singularly devoted her attention to “person” and was relatively unconcerned about all those “things” which had consumed her sister. Jesus settled the matter by saying, “Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.” I had become a Martha, overly concerned with “things,” instead of a Mary who lovingly devoted herself to the “person” and words of Jesus Christ.  For those of you who, like me, are sometimes more like Martha than we’d like to admit, “things” do still have to get done at times. But let’s remember to never put these “things” before “people,” or the things that are of greater spiritual importance.  There is one additional point I’d like to make from Jesus’ words in this text. Note that Jesus also told Martha that though she was “worried and bothered about many things; only one thing is necessary…”  ( v.42a ). I may be wrong about this, but I don’t think the “one thing” Jesus mentioned had anything to do with how many dishes of food Martha was preparing. The “one thing” that was “necessary” was a reference to what Mary had been doing- feeding on the Word of God. Martha had been concerned with the physical food she thought she needed to provide for Jesus, and He is saying that the spiritual food He had been providing Mary and the others was much more important. He had been giving them “the bread of God…come down from heaven, (that) gives life to the world”  John 6:33-35 . Please join me in striving to keep the spiritual always ahead of the physical , OK?","I think money has fast becoming one of the most important thing in the life for a lot of us.","Things are changes but people remain sane till last.","Things and people are like shadow and object never go away from each other."],"title":["People vs. Things"],"_resultNumber":223,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/people_vs._things","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":223},{"body":["From time to time, I have the opportunity to study with a young couple who want to get married, regarding what God intended and requires marriage to be (actually, it’s mandatory if I perform the wedding). In trying to underscore the importance of true love and maturity to the relationship, I’ve often utilized statements along these lines:  “A young man doesn’t really understand what true love, maturity, and the awesome responsibility of family ‘headship’ is all about until he has a child. Prior to that point, he’s lived a selfish life. He cried to get what he wanted when he was little, perhaps pouted or became angry to get it when he was older, and bullied, talked, or cajoled his way into getting it as a young man. He may even marry for purely selfish reasons! Other people in his life enabled him to remain selfish by mostly playing along or giving in to his wants. They could have said “No,” and refused to continue to placate his demands because they weren’t dependent upon him . But once he becomes a father, everything usually (and certainly should!) change. That little screaming, cooing life that faintly resembles him is different- it is completely dependent upon him in ways that his parents, siblings, friends, girlfriends, and wife never were! This new life that came from him therefore melts his selfish heart, and hopefully matures his mind and conduct.”  It is probably about this same time, and for the same reason (the birth of his child), that a young man begins to truly comprehend God’s love for us. He begins to understand how God  invested  some of Himself in mankind from Genesis 1:27 , “And God created man in His own image…” when he sees his own characteristics reflected in his child. He begins to understand his own  complete dependence  on His heavenly Father (from Romans 5:6 , “For while we were still helpless…” ) when he’s trying to comfort his own crying child in the middle of the night. He begins to understand  true love  (from Romans 5:8 , “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us…” )when his own heart wants to break at the least hurt of his child. And He begins to understand  true sacrifice  (from Romans 5:10 , “For while we were yet enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son…” ) when all of his selfish desires and pursuits are willingly sacrificed for the slightest benefit of his child.  While this young man may have “known” about these things previously on some level, through this life-changing bundle of joy, he now “understands” a whole lot more about how God thinks, feels, and acts toward us.  The human birth of Jesus was necessitated by one thing: Man’s need of salvation from sin. Romans 6:23 tells us that the just penalty for sin is death. Unless all men were to die for their own sins, a Perfect Man would have to die in their stead. Being sinless, His death could then atone for other’s sins since He would have none of His own needing atonement ( cf.Hebrews 9:7,11-14 ). But by intrinsic nature, “God” cannot die- He is eternal. Therefore, in order to atone for man’s sins, God had to assume human form. This He did by being born of a virgin (of divine, rather than human, progeny), “Jesus of Nazareth.” Then “the fullness of Deity…was in bodily form” ( Colossians 2:9 )- and this human form of the very Son of God could atone for man’s sins through death. Simply put: the birth of Jesus is important because it allowed Him to die for our sins.   But unless we’re really sharp and studious of the Word, we may not really appreciate God’s  investment of Himself in human form, or our complete dependence on Him , or the true love  He has for us, or the true nature of His  sacrifice ; that is, until we have children of our own in which we have invested ourselves , who are (at least initially) so completely dependent upon us , who we  love so completely , and for whom we are willing to sacrifice our very lives to save.

These pledges are usually not too hard to come up with since the same ones we made last year are again available! So, we renew our commitments to take better care of  ourselves by losing weight/bad habits, eating better, sleeping more, and exercising (at least some ). We also promise to do a better job with the  externals - managing our time, money, and other resources more profitably. And then too, we declare that we’re going to work on improving our  relationships . In the New Year we’re going to be better parents, children, spouses, bosses, employees, and friends. This all sounds, and actually is, good- if we’re really serious about changing this time around. But the track record of the past doesn’t bode well for us. Have you thought about making (and keeping!) some spiritual resolutions instead, or at least in addition to these others?   Will you commit to losing the extra weight of sin this year?  Hebrews 12:1 talks about “running with endurance” the spiritual race that is before us. Running any race with a lot of extra baggage attached is almost, if not altogether, impossible. This same verse also urges us to “lay aside every weight, and the sin which clings so closely,” (English Standard Version) . We simply can’t run this race successfully while carrying about a “body of sin.” Free yourself from all the “extra weight of sin ” ( Roman 6:3-6 ) this year.   Will you resolve to auditing and allocating your resources differently this year? Saul of Tarsus (aka Paul) likely was either already a member of, or was being groomed to be a member of, the Jewish Sanhedrin counsel. This was a very powerful and likely profitable position. But when he became convinced of the deity of Jesus Christ, he immediately turned his back on the all the amenities that his former position afforded him. In speaking of this, he said, \"But whatever things were gain to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ. More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord...and count them but rubbish in order that I may gain Christ,” ( Philippians 3:7-8 ). I am certainly not suggesting that you “give up” your possessions to me, or the church (I/we are interested in your soul’s salvation, not your money) - but I am suggesting that we must all keep these physical things in the proper perspective. Jesus said to “lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven....for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also,”  Matthew 6:19-21 . Make sure heaven is your primary “bank account” this next year.   Will you pledge to improve your spiritual relationships this year?  1John 3:1 speaks of the blessed privilege Christians have “that we should be called children of God.” Have you neglected your spiritual Parent? Do you speak to Him often in prayer? Do you regularly seek counsel and wisdom in His Word(s)? Do you go and spend time with Him each week to show how much you love and care for Him? Will you work at improving your relationship with Him this year? And what about His other children- your siblings, are you going to do a better job of being “devoted to one another in brotherly love” and in giving “preference to one another in honor” from Romans 12:10 ? Give preference to your “spiritual relationships” this year.  See? It doesn’t have to be a long list of resolutions to accomplish some pretty major improvements in your life. What about it? Are you just going to resolve the same old things this year as you did last year?

Men of mental prowess, who have great commitment to study biblical Truth, can help bring us to better understanding of what God would have us to be.  The Hebrews writer seems to speak to that potential in Hebrews 6:12-13 , “And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end, that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.” Similarly, the Apostle Paul often encouraged brethren to hold in high regard those who labored for, and led them, cf. Phil.2:29 ; 1Cor.16:18 ; 1Thess.5:12-13 .  However, not all men of understanding are equally adept at applying scripture to their own lives. Solomon was declared to be the wisest man of his generation, and yet oft failed to adequately apply his wisdom to the obedience of God’s Word. In this way, we all likely fall short. Which of us does not know more divine Truth than we live? Still yet, there is much that can be learned from those who “receive the word with great eagerness, examining the scriptures daily, to see whether these things were so.” ( Acts 17:11 , spoken of the Bereans)  With these few thoughts in mind, please consider carefully the quote below. It was the prayer of John Baillie, a Scottish theologian and professor at the famed Edinburgh University. There he sought to influence young men’s minds toward awareness of the omnipresence of God in their lives. Mr. Baillie also wrote “A Dairy of Private Prayer” (1936) which came to be regarded as a devotional classic. But some have suggested that his most important contribution to theology in general was his teaching, writing, and lecturing on the relationship between the knowledge of God and man’s spiritual and moral experience– that is, and surely over-simplified, doing what we know to be right. I think you’ll see evidence of that conviction in his words:   “Teach me, O God, to use all the circumstances of my life today that they may bring forth in me the fruits of holiness rather than the fruits of sin. Let me use disappointment as material for patience; Let me use success as material for thankfulness; Let me use suspense as material for perseverance; Let me use danger as material for courage; Let me use reproach as material for longsuffering; Let me use praise as material for humility; Let me use pleasures as material for temperance; Let me use pains as material for endurance.”   What a wonderful petition! That in all of life’s circumstances, whatever they may be– whether pleasant or tragic, we allow the Lord of the Universe to use them to teach us to be godly. Life is to be a journey of learning, but not learning for mere knowledge’s sake. Learning is useless without application in one’s life. In the sense of divine knowledge which is not applied, it is sinful– James 4:17, “Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do, and does not do it, to him it is sin.”   When our minds and hearts are filled with the knowledge of divine text, we can then interpret all of life’s situations and circumstances through that prism of understanding, so that we act and react according to God’s will for us. Thus, when we, armed with the knowledge of God’s word, meet the circumstances of daily life, we understand them to be opportunities to grow in wisdom through living godly. Such is the essence of having the “senses trained to discern good and evil,”  Hebrews 5:14 .  So, how are you doing? Life “got you down?” Not if your mind is filled with the knowledge of God’s word, your heart is filled with the desire to “learn what is pleasing to Him” ( Eph.5:10 ), and your body is willing to be “led by the Spirit of God” ( Rom.8:14 ). Then, each of life’s obstacles– and they come in “good” and “bad” forms as evidenced by Mr. Baillie’s prayer, is an opportunity to learn more and do more toward the ultimate goal of heaven!

The Bible nowhere defines or uses the term that way. Instead, a “saint” is a Christian, whether alive or dead- one who is “sanctified” ( set apart from the world, PCS) in Christ,”  1Corinthians 1:2 . Contrastingly, everyone is a “sinner” in the sense of having violated the law of God- so says Romans 3:23 . But the New Testament also uses the term “sinner” to describe those who are supposedly the antithesis of God’s people. I say “supposedly” because the line between “saint” and “sinner” is not always as distinct as it ought to be. 1John 3:10 says it should be “obvious.” The blurring of this line of distinction is not due to the “sinners” becoming more “saintly” either!  Jesus made it very clear that He expects those who claim to be His people to feel and live differently from those of the world. Note two quick examples from Luke 6 .   “And if you love those who love you , what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.”  ( v.32 ) Loving those who don’t love youis evidence of being a child of God according to Matthew 5:45 . Of what then, is loving only those who love you evidence? Don’t let the title you give yourself fool you- God isn’t deceived. If we refuse to love those who don’t love us, we’re more “sinner” than “saint”! If you want to be numbered among God’s people, love differently, more, and better than the sinners by loving those who don’t love you.   “And if you do good to those who do good to you , what credit is that to you? For even the sinners do the same thing.”  ( v.33 ) It’s not just important to feel the right way about those who don’t reciprocate those emotions, it’s also vital to do the right things to/for them, even if they do the wrong things to you. Jesus spoke to this very point in the Sermon on the Mount, “But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He Himself is kind to ungrateful and evil men.” ( Luke 6:35 ) Thinking and feeling the right way about “sinners” is essential to being a “saint” primarily because without the right mindset, the right activity will never follow! Unless we love and live better than “the sinners” we are not really “saints” at all!  So, what happens when a supposed “saint” loves and lives no better than “the sinners”? To be blunt, since he has decided to “play for the other team,” his brethren should make it clear to him that he’s switched sides by withdrawing their fellowship from him. That is what both the Thessalonian and the Corinthian churches were told to do with their unrepentant sinful saints, cf. 2Thessalonians 3:6-14 and 1Corinthians 5:1-13 . Why this course? Hopefully, the drastic disciplinary action will cause him to repent and return to living the way saints should so “that his spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus,”  1Corinthians 5:5b .  But there are additional reasons to withdraw fellowship from saints who live like sinners. Such people have a very detrimental effect on other members of the church who are trying to do the right thing(s). Paul warned the Corinthians of this danger with the rhetorical question, “Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough?” (see 1Corinthians 5:6 ).  Also, saints who live like sinners actually become a dangerous deterrent to the spread of the gospel. In Romans 2:23-24 , Paul is addressing the supposed “people of God” who were, in fact, sinners, with these stinging words, “You who boast in the Law, through your breaking the Law, do you dishonor God? For ‘the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles ( or sinners, PCS ) because of you,’ just as it is written.” Not only do saints who live like sinners miss heaven themselves, they cause others to miss it as well through their hypocritical example!  Please remember Jesus’ words from Matthew 5:20 , “For I say to you, that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven”. The “Scribes and Pharisees” were actually supposed to be God’s people, but lived more like sinners than saints, cf. Matthew 23 .

Braude collected and published hundreds of quotes for use in speeches for all occasions. I confess I do not have any of his published works. So I am uncertain if the following quote is an original of his, or one of the other quotes he published. At any rate, consider this tidbit of wisdom: “Life is a grindstone; whether it grinds you down or polishes you up depends on what you’re made of.\"   While this thing called “life” doesn’t always have to be as hard as we make it ( cf. Proverbs 13:15; 29:6 ), there is no doubt that everyone has their troubles. No one truly lives free from heartache and pain provided they live long enough to make it out of diapers! We look back to Adam and Eve’s sin in the Garden of Eden, and the subsequent loss of the only true “Paradise” man ever had, as the beginning of the difficulties of life. In response to their sin, God said life from then on would be filled with pain, sweat, and toil ( Genesis 3:16-19 ). But we can’t really blame them. We’ve all sinned too ( Romans 3:23 ), and therefore can’t claim that it’s their fault without being hypocritical.  The “grindstone” of life takes many forms- disease, death, despair, and difficulties of all forms make living tough at times. But if everyone has hardships in life, why do some seem to rise above them while others never seem to escape their quagmires? We might be tempted to say that the extent of the hardship is the determining factor, but we’d be wrong. Some folks overcome tremendous adversities, while others become completely undone by relatively minor obstacles. So the degree of difficulty can’t be the determining factor. Mr. Braude had it right when he suggested that the content of one’s character is the answer.  “Bad things” happen to “good people” too. But “good people” deal with these “bad things” differently. How so? They seem to recognize several salient points:    That it is Satan, not God, who desires our destruction and will use any means he can to accomplish it, cf. Ezekiel 18:32; John 8:44 . Remember that it was Satan who tormented Job!   That God never promised that “this” life was fair. The reward of faithful lives of obedience is heaven- not “heaven on earth.” If life here was a paradise free of hardship, what desire would we have for eternal glory? 2Corinthians 5:2-4 , “For indeed in this house we groan, longing to be clothed with our dwelling from heaven; inasmuch as we, having put it on, shall not be found naked. For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed, but to be clothed, in order that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.”    That these difficulties are supposed to teach us how to live better, and happier.  James 1:2-4 , “Consider all joy, by brethren, when you encounter various trials; knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.”    That “this life,” with all its difficulties, is not all there is.  2Corinthians 4:16-17 , “Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day. For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison…”    Everyone faces the “grindstone” of life. Some are “polished” and perfected for an eternal dwelling with God, and some are “ground down” and destined to an eternal destruction with Satan. Which will it be for you? The answer, in part at least, is determined by how you react to life’s difficulties."],"title":["Ground Down or Polished Up?"],"_resultNumber":229,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/ground_down_or_polished_up","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":229},{"body":["Then future President Ronald Reagan, while on the campaign trail in 1980, famously said, “A recession is when your next door neighbor loses  his  job. A depression is when you lose  your  job. And a recovery is when Mr. Carter loses his job!” It was a great line, and President Carter did subsequently lose his job to Mr. Reagan. But I didn’t bring up this quote to write about politics, but  perspective  ...  Our perspective often changes when we’re on the “receiving end” of some misfortune or mishap. What we might deem “unfortunate” if it happens to someone else suddenly becomes “tragic” if it happens to us!  The same principle of perspective can be seen in our view of “sin.” If someone else commits the offense, it may be deemed “reprehensible” or “unforgiveable” to us. But if we are guilty of the same thing, it somehow magically becomes only a “mistake,” or an “error in judgment.” We may then question whether it’s really even a sin at all, “given the circumstances” (meaning that we are otherwise now the guilty one).  Issues of perspective are not limited to us as individuals either. They can be observed in our attitudes toward our families. A youngster can be deemed “spoiled, rebellious, disruptive, lacking discipline, etc.” if it belongs to someone else, but if or when our child does the same thing(s), he or she suddenly becomes “cute, full of personality, active, etc.” Often, the only real difference in the children is to whom they belong. As the old saying goes, “It’s different when the shoe is on the other foot!”  Unfortunately, these differences in perspective influence more than just our attitudes. As a result of this skewedperspective, we become judgmental and harsh toward others, despite being tolerant and patient with ourselves and our families (perhaps even to a fault). But our judgment cannot help but be influenced, even unduly so, by our perspective.  Perhaps this is why Jesus dealt with perspective before dealing with judgment in the Sermon on the Mount. Notice His words in Matthew 6:22 , “The lamp of the body is the eye; if therefore the eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light.” Our metaphorical “eye” should be focused on the divine perspective. When it is, our “whole body will be full of light”- of which Jesus is the true source ( cf. John 1:9 ). Then we will “see” things as God sees them, and our judgments will be in keeping with His. Obviously, the inverse is true also. When our “eye” lacks the divine perspective, our judgments will tend toward more worldly estimations and conclusions.  So after first dealing with perspective, Jesus then addressed “judging” in Matthew 7:3-4 , “And why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ and behold, the log is in your own eye?” The Lord is not saying that we shouldn’t issue any judgments at all, for then we could not fulfill His command of the next verse, “You hypocrite,  first  take the log out of your own eye, and  then  you will see clearly to take the speck your of your brother’s eye.”  Hypocritical judgments, made from worldly motives and without the benefit of divine perspective, are being condemned. The Savior further emphasized this very point in John 7:24 , “Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.” He expects, even commands, us to help one another “see” our sins for the very reason we’ve highlighted: While it is relatively easy to the see the sins of others, it is often difficult to see our own. Having the right (divine) perspective will allow us to clearly see both. Hopefully, it will also allow us to feel the same way about our own sins as we do those of others. After all, in the end we are all dependent upon the grace and mercy of God “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,”  Romans 3:23 .  It truly is amazing what a little perspective can do for us- especially so when it is  divine  perspective!"],"title":["Perspective"],"_resultNumber":230,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/perspective","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":230},{"body":["This article takes a slightly different approach in addressing whether salvation is by \"faith only\" or by \"faith and works.\"  Anyone who has spent any time at all reading the New Testament has noted the important role that faith (belief) plays in salvation. Hebrews 11:6 tells us that “without faith it is impossible to please Him…” Having that “assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen” ( v.1 ) is the very foundation of our relationship with God. Numerous other passages likewise extol the necessity of biblical faith, John 3:16; 8:24; Romans 4:1-6; Ephesians 2:8-9; et al  . No student of the text would deny the necessity of faith in salvation.  However, it is often stated in one way or another that “salvation is by faith only.” To be fair, if the passages above are all that we read from the New Testament on the subjects of faith and salvation, such might be a fair assessment. But these passages are not all that God said on the matter. So please carefully consider this question: If salvation is indeed by “faith only” (with no mixture of works), then why do the N.T. passages which depict the eternal judgment of man say that it is based on what he did, or did not do ? Please note: Revelation 20:12 , “And I saw the dead, the great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened…and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds .”  Matthew 16:27 , “For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and will then recompense every man according to His deeds. ”  Romans 2:5-6 , “…you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his deeds .”  2Corinthians 5:10 , “For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done , whether good or bad.” (see also Matthew 25:14-46 and Revelation 20:13 )  Additionally, if salvation is by “faith only” (with no mixture of works), then I don’t understand why Jesus called faith a “work” in John 6:28-29 , “They said therefore to Him, ‘What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?’ Jesus answered and said to them, ‘This is the work of God, that you believe in Him who He has sent.” According to Jesus faith/belief is a “work”- so how can salvation be by “faith only without any mixture of works whatsoever” if faith itself is a work? Neither can I understand why James would write, “Even so faith, if it has no works is dead, being by itself” ( James 2:17 ) if salvation is by “faith only.” He further added in James 2:24 , “You see that a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone.” Friends, these words of Jesus and James just don’t seem to make sense if salvation is by “faith only.”  So how do all these passages really fit together? Some state that salvation is by faith, and some affirm that faith alone (without works) is dead and can’t save us. The skeptic might conclude that they are contradictory, but asserting such doesn’t make it so. We are saved through faith; we are saved by grace; and we are saved by doing what God says (works). Here’s the simple solution. God requires two things of man before salvation is given: 1) faith; and 2) obedience. Take the Great Commission as proof: In Mark 16:16 Jesus said, “He who has believed” (that’s faith) “and has been baptized” (that’s something we do- hence a work) “shall be saved; but he who has disbelieved shall be condemned.” The truth is that we cannot pile up enough “good works” to earn salvation, no matter how righteously we live, because the “works” God requires of us do not equate in value to the benefit we receive. By the way, isn’t that the very definition of “grace”- getting more than we deserve? But knowing that our deeds do not equate in value to the eternal value of salvation does not mean that we can be saved without doing what God says either. In this way, salvation isn’t by “faith alone” because our obedience demonstrates our faith to God and others ( cf. James 2:18 ). And salvation isn’t by “works alone” either because without God’s grace and our faith, our works just can’t merit salvation! It’s just like Galatians 5:6 (and our title) says, salvation is by “faith working through love.” Please think about these things carefully- eternal life hangs in the balance."],"title":["“Faith Working Through Love”"],"_resultNumber":231,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/faith_working_through_love","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":231},{"body":["The human mind can be a strange place. There’s stuff in there that we’ll never figure out. I am truly amazed at the extreme intelligence of some folks, and equally befuddled at the complete lack of common sense in others. I suppose that means I’m somewhere in the middle- most folks are. We mediocre-minded masses may not be the sharpest knives in the drawer, but we are smarter than a box of hammers! Admittedly, I typically swim in the shallow end of the pool of thought. But whether we’re blazingly brilliant or downright dim, what  counts in life is more often determined by attitude rather than I.Q.   To illustrate, consider three responses to a typical question: “How are you today?” The first fellow says, “I’m finer than a frog hair split in two.” Not to doubt the veracity of his statement, but he was laying in a hospital bed in his living room dying of cancer at the time. You tell me: If that was his attitude in that situation, what kind of a day was he going to have? You bet it was going to be a good one, and he was going to enjoy every minute of it!  The second fellow answers the question with “Not quite as good as I look.” Now this man is admitting that he has difficulties of some sort, but you have to admire his style! Self-confidence is good and even necessary at times, as long as it’s not overdone. I know this man well- arrogance or overconfidence is not part of his character, and never has been. He was just teasing the questioner. But again, there is a point to be made. We all have problems, but those who get up each day and present themselves to the world, their brethren, and their God in the best way possible are going to have a better day than the one who sees nothing but obstacles, and thus allows circumstances to overcome him. Proverbs 26:13-16 describes “the sluggard” as one who sees only problems (real or imagined), and therefore just turns  as a door on its hinges in his bed .  The third fellow answers the question with “Better than I deserve, but not quite as well as I had hoped.” He too is mostly joking. However, there is a lesson or three in these words too. This responder readily admits the grace of God has allowed him to do “better than” he deserved. He evidently understands that if he was “doing” only as well as he deserved, it would not be “good.” There is an honest consideration in such that we all need to admit. But he also concedes that his mortal side longs for more. Perhaps this is only human, but is probably all too human for one who desires to become a “partaker of the divine nature” ( 2Peter 1:4 ). The temporal, finite part of us always wants to feel better, have more, etc. Nonetheless, contentment must also be a part of our Christian character. “But godliness is actually is a means of great gain, when accompanied by contentment.” ( 1Timothy 6:6 ; see also vv.7-8ff )  “It’s all in your head” is true  if  : “head” includes “heart,” and we’re talking about attitude. W. Clement Stone (1902-2002) was truly a “rags to riches” story. His father died when he was three, and left the family deep in debt. Stone began selling newspapers at age six, and quickly became an innovator. By sixteen, he was selling insurance from office to office in Detroit. In 1919 (at the ripe old age of seventeen), he formed the Combined Insurance Company, which after years of growth and mergers, was eventually sold for $2.56 billion. Throughout his life, Stone was said to have given $275 million to charity. This information is to establish a basis for two quotes from Mr. Stone. First, “There is little difference in people…the little difference is attitude. The big difference is whether it is positive or negative.” And secondly, despite writing self-help books himself, Stone said, “The Bible is the world’s greatest self-help book.” Despite his great success and wealth, Mr. Stone realized that there was much more to life than these ( Luke 12:15b ). It truly is “all in your head” if biblical attitudes are there!

The phrase has to do with getting things out of order. Perhaps more specifically, it has to do with attempting to do one thing before something else that must necessarily come first. For those unfamiliar with carts and horses, the cart always hitches up behind the horse, rather than in front of him. Thus, those who get things out of the proper and necessary order are “getting the cart in front of the horse.” It’s kind of like trying to “push a chain”- but that’s another story for another time, I suppose. As you may have surmised by now, there is a spiritual application to this whole “horse and cart” thing....  Occasionally, I’ve had someone tell me he wanted to wait “until I get my life straightened out to become a Christian.” Now there’s a cart in front of a horse! There is no doubt that John told some Pharisees and Sadducees that they needed to “bring forth fruits in keeping with repentance” before baptism. But if you look carefully at the context of Matthew 3:5-12 , you’ll see that he did so in that case because of their hypocrisy. They didn’t really believe they needed to repent of anything. They assumed they were already saved, rather than truly repenting and turning to God through baptism. That’s not the situation at all with the people who say they want to get their life straightened out before they’re baptized. Such is a “horse of a different color” altogether (sorry, that one just slipped right out)!  In such a case, “getting my life straightened out” is the cart, and being baptized is the horse. When we come to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, and decide to obey Him by being “born again” in baptism ( John 3:3-5 ; Romans 6:3-4 ), we become a “new creature” ( 2Corinthians 5:17 ), or a “babe” ( 1Peter 2:2 ), in Christ. From that point, we must grow and develop into a mature Christian. As we mature in Christ, our lives are transformed by renewing our minds to the will of God, rather than simply conforming to the sinful world around us ( Romans 12:2 ). In this maturation process, our lives get “straightened out” when we learn “to discern good and evil” ( Hebrews 5:14 ) from God’s word, and live accordingly. If we attempt to get our lives straight prior to becoming a Christian, we are definitely trying to put the cart in front of the horse!  But I’ve often suspected that those who say they want to get their lives “straightened out before becoming a Christian” really mean, “I’m not through enjoying my sinful life yet!” They have in their minds that when they get through sowing all their “wild oats,” then they will “settle down” and become a Christian. But there is definitely a horse fly in this ointment (sorry, there I go again!). The problem with sowing “wild oats” is that they almost always produce a distasteful crop we have to harvest and eat! Note Galatians 6:7-8 on this point, “Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap. For the one who sows to his own flesh shall from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit shall from the Spirit reap eternal life.”   When we choose to “sow our wild oats” now and “become a Christian” later, there is always the possibility that sin becomes so ingrained in our lives that we can’t shake free. Esau apparently had that problem, “when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears,”  Hebrews 12:17 . Then too, no one is promised a tomorrow to repent and become a Christian, “Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts,”  Hebrews 3:15 .  You may not have grown up on a farm like me, and you may not know how to hitch a cart to horse either, but you can do the first things first!

It doesn’t matter whether you speak Texan or Spanish, there is a word for “not now, maybe later.” In Texan, the word is “aroundtuit”- as in, “When I get ‘aroundtuit’ I’ll take care of that for you.” For those who might not speak Texan, the word “aroundtuit” does  not  necessarily imply that one is otherwise occupied, or otherwise unable to perform the specific task under consideration at the moment. It just means he’s not going to do it right now!  Furthermore, he may not ever get “aroundtuit,” but will perpetually kept the task on the “to do” list just the same. Such reminds me of the time a fellow told me he would never beat me out of the money he owed me. He said he might die owing me, but he wouldn’t beat me out of it! Aroundtuits are like that too.  Our Spanish-speaking friends have a word that doesn’t translate into aroundtuit, but it gets to the same place anyway. Their word is “mañana.” More properly, mañana usually refers to “in the morning” or “tomorrow”- but that’s only when it is used more properly . When most folks say “mañana” they just mean “not now, maybe later.” See? Spanish-speakers have a word for aroundtuit also!  Such is all well and good as long as we’re talking about some chore the wife or the neighbor wants you to do for them. In those cases, either “aroundtuit” or “mañana” will do depending on which language is more appropriate. But what about if “it” is instead some duty or responsibility owed to God? Well friend, that is a horse of a different color in any language!  Several O.T. passages stress the importance of not delaying when it comes to fulfilling our responsibilities to God: “Seek the Lord while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near.” ( Isaiah 55:6 ); “Give glory to the Lord your God, before He brings darkness and before your feet stumble on the dusky mountains, and while you are hoping for light He makes it into deep darkness, and turns it into gloom.” ( Jeremiah 13:16 ); “When you make a vow to the Lord your God, you shall not delay to pay it, for it would be sin in you, and the Lord you God will surely require it of you.” ( Deuteronomy 23:21 ); and the Psalmist added, “I hastened and did not delay to keep Your commandments.” ( Psalm 119:60 ).  Why do you suppose so much is said in the Bible about procrastinating? Could it be that the God who created us best knows our weaknesses and tendencies?  Absitively  and  posolutely!  Therefore He said, “Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring forth.” ( Proverbs 27:1 ). In the Epistle of James, after echoing some of the same warnings and reasons as above, He added, “Therefore, to the one who knows the right thing to do, and does not do it, to him it is sin.” ( James 4:17 ) The meaning of these things is pretty clear: God doesn’t accept “aroundtuits” or “mañanas”! He expects us to read, understand, and obey His Law  now  while we still have the opportunity to do so. The danger of procrastination is shown by parable in Luke 13:25 , “Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door, saying, ‘Lord open up to us!’ then He will answer and say to you, ‘I do not know where you are from.’” You can wait too long to obey the Lord.  “Aroundtuits” and “mañanas” may work with your neighbor- they may even get you by with your wife, but they won’t work with God! Friend, if “getting right with the Lord” is on your to-do list, don’t wait until you get “aroundtuit” or until “mañana”- do it now. “But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called “Today,” lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.” ( Hebrews 3:13 ) Remember, “now” is the only time any of us is guaranteed."],"title":["Aroundtuits and Mañana"],"_resultNumber":234,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/aroundtuits_and_manana","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":234},{"body":["Recently, a friend of mine said of a mutual acquaintance of ours, “He doesn’t hear well, and he doesn’t listen well either.” This statement was a commentary on both the man’s physical difficulties with hearing, and his attitudinal difficulties with listening. More personally, another friend of mine quotes me as having said to him on multiple occasions (at least as he tells it), “You have vastly over-estimated my interest in this subject.” So I apparently have the same problem as the first fellow- we don’t always listen well!  Physical impairments are something we’d all much rather avoid, if possible, but over which we often have little control. As we age, our eyes and ears often lose their strength just as do our arms, legs, heart, lungs, and minds- we just wear out, and there is precious little we can do to avoid it short of dying young. But the other part- about not listening well, is another matter altogether.  By way of contrast to these things, I recently had the honor of speaking at the funeral of a brother in Christ. In making preparations for the service, I visited with the family and asked them to describe their loved one, and specifically, to tell me some things about him that impressed them the most. One of the responses I received, while not surprising at all, was striking with regard to the degree of appreciation they expressed for that particular characteristic in him. They said, “He was an excellent listener,” and then proceeded to provide many examples of his abilities in this area. I quickly confessed that he was a much better man than I in that regard (and surely in many others as well). But it was so moving to hear family members lovingly describe how much they appreciated his ability to, and willingness to, listen well. And coupled with the opening examples of this article, it emphasized the rarity of the ability to truly “listen well.”  Jesus once spoke disparagingly of His audience, “In their case the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, ‘You will keep on hearing, but will not understand; and you will keep on seeing, but will not perceive; for the heart of this people has become dull, and with their ears they scarcely hear, and they have closed their eyes; lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart and turn again, and I should heal them.” ( Matthew 13:14-15 ) In applying Isaiah’s words to His audience, Jesus is not indicating that there was any physical impairment to their eyes or ears, but a spiritual impairment to their hearts! When one refuses to “see” and “listen” to God’s words, spiritual cardiosclerosis ( heart hardening ) has surely occurred!  But aside from this obvious spiritual difficulty, why is it that some of us just don’t listen well? Here are my best guesses:   Perceived Self-Importance. Quite simply, we’re much more interested in what we have to say than hearing what anyone else has to say. Consequently, we only really listen for the pauses in their speech so we can interject our own thoughts without so obviously interrupting. This is incongruent with Philippians 2:3 , “Do nothing from selfishness of empty conceit, but with humility of mind let each of you regard one another as more important than himself…”    Impatience. Certainly, this one is related to the previous suggestion. That is, because we consider what we have to say so much superior to whatever anyone else might say, we don’t have the patience (or courtesy) to sincerely listen to them. But patience is a “fruit of the Spirit” we Christians are supposed to not only possess, but practice, cf. Galatians 5:22ff ! We are told in James 1:19 , “let every one be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.” Is it possible that our difficulties with the second two of these imperatives result from a failure in regard to the first one?  It doesn’t require any special skills to be a good listener to God, or others. It just requires us to have the right heart- one that is humble, patient, kind, and wise…which is obviously the real problem many of us face. Let’s all become better listeners by improving our hearts, OK?"],"title":["Hearing Well"],"_resultNumber":235,"_widgetName":"sscoc","_source":["7d9bef9f-c2f2-4410-be91-914d9270f23d"],"_connectorVersionGuid":"a5b1d48f-f157-4666-b978-a5ac50952f91","_pageUrl":"http://www.southsidechurchofchrist.net/articles/content/hearing_well","_outputTypes":{"body":"STRING","title":"STRING"},"_input":{},"_num":235},{"body":["In Acts 2:37 , when confronted with the truth that Jesus was indeed the Christ, and the realization of their sins came full-force upon them, the assembled audience asked the most important question anyone can ask regarding salvation, “What shall we do?” Note they didn’t ask “What shall we believe ?” or “What shall we feel ?” or even “What shall we experience ?” No, they asked, “What shall we  do  ?” Even these yet unpardoned murderers of the Messiah understood that salvation required activity on  The response came quickly and concisely from Peter, “Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins…”  v.38 . Note again, they were not told what to think, feel, or experience; they were told what to do to be saved. Given even this small amount of information, how anyone can say that man does not, and cannot, do anything to attain salvation is simply amazing. Read the text for yourself. These people were lost because of sin; they desired to be saved from the eternal consequence of their sins; they asked what they needed to do to attain forgiveness; and were told what to do to be forgiven. As one of my old preaching mentors used to say, “You have to have help to miss that- you can’t miss it by yourself!”  Does that mean baptism “alone” saves us? Of course not! The verse itself includes repentance as being required. Please, please, please understand this vital point: The N.T. does not say that anything alone saves us- not “baptism alone,” not “repentance alone,” not “confession alone,” not “grace alone,” and not “faith alone” (though at least these two words do appear together in the text- but it instead says “You see that a man is justified by works, and  not  by faith alone.”  James 2:26 ). Nothing “alone” saves us- not even “the blood of Jesus alone” saves us. Think about it: if the blood of Jesus “alone” saved us, then everyone would be saved because it was shed for the sins of everyone, right? But not everyone will be saved. Jesus made this very plain in Matthew 7:21 , “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven; but he who  does  the will of My Father, who is in heaven.”   Look, the N.T. says that all of the above mentioned items save us: baptism, 1Peter 3:21 ; repentance, Acts 3:19 ; confession, Matthew 10:32 ; grace, Ephesians 2:8 ; faith, Romans 5:1 ; and blood, Ephesians 1:7 . However, none of them “alone” saves us- it is the concerted combination of them all that orchestrates salvation.  But if you’re insistent on looking for “one thing” that will produce deliverance from sin, I suppose it would have to be the Gospel, “for it is the power of God for salvation,”  Romans 1:16 . Even here, however, activity is required on our part. The power of the gospel doesn’t work by osmosis! Jesus said, “you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free,”  John 8:32 ; and by inspiration, Peter added, “Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls…”  1Peter 1:22 . The power of the gospel to save is dependent upon our study and knowledge of it, and our willingness to humbly submit ourselves to it in obedience. If we don’t know it- we can’t obey it. If we know it, but don’t obey it, it won’t save us in our disobedience.

Things like: a sharp pole ax with a good handle; or a good steak cooked over an open fire; or an evening spent at home with beloved ones playing a game and laughing; or a drive down a tree-covered road with the windows rolled down in a vehicle old enough that I can still hear and feel the engine’s surging growl; or a hand-holding stroll in the cool of the evening conversing with the love of my life; or a morning spent by the softly-crackling glow of the fireplace with a large cup of coffee and my Bible.

But please don’t allow all these “techno toys” to prevent or even precede the things that really matter: the value of simple hard work that produces sweat; an appreciation of the wonderful world God created for us to enjoy in person, rather than by digital representations; the joy and love of family up close, without typed letters and electronically delivered hugs; and the profound pleasure of reading, studying, and living the Bible- it lives and abides forever you know, 1Peter.1:23 . These are simple things, good things, things that will never become obsolete with the next generation of technological gadgetry.
